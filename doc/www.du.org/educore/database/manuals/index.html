eDUcore MOO Core Manuals</H1>

<HR SIZE=4 WIDTH="100%">

<P>The eDUcore manual collection is a set of Web documents containing the
text of the online help available from within the eDUcore itself.&nbsp;
These Web documents may be easily browsed, printed, or used to preview
the features of the eDUcore. The same text is available from within an
eDUcore MOO itself, through the "help" command.

<P>Like the eDUcore help databases, the manuals are organized functionally,
primarily according to character class (user, builder, programmer, manager,
and wizard).&nbsp; Some accessory manuals (VSPO, editor, functions, core
objects, and FUP) present supporting features or provide greater detail
on special topics.

<P><B>IMPORTANT!</B> The eDUcore manuals, like the eDUcore itself, are
based upon the LambdaMOO core from which they were originally derived and
extended.&nbsp; While the changes and additions Diversity University has
made to these texts are copyright Diversity University, the original LambadMOO
texts retain their original copyright.
