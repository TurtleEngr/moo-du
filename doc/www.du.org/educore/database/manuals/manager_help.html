<P>If a person has a bad email address, it usually becomes apparent when
<BR>the MOO tries to mail them something and it bounces.  You can then
<BR>use:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;@register &lt;who&gt; ""

<P>to set a blank email address for the person, and they'll receive the

<P>With no argument, the current contents of the corresponding list are printed.

<P>If the given domain or subnet has subdomains/subsubnets that are already on the list, you will be prompted as to whether you want to remove them.  Note that adding an entry for a particular domain or subnet effectively adds all subdomains/subsubnets, so unless there's some reason for keeping an explicit entry for a particular subdomain, chances are you will indeed want to remove them.  One reason to keep an explicit entry for a subdomain would be if you intended to unlist the full domain later but wanted to be sure you didn't unlist the subdomain in the process.

<BR>@chown &lt;object&gt;:&lt;verbname&gt; [to] &lt;owner&gt;</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>Changes the ownership of the indicated object, property or verb.

<P>Verb ownership changes are fairly straightforward, being merely a matter of changing the verb_info() on a single verb.

<P>Changing an object ownership includes changing the ownership on all +c properties on that object.  Note that @chown will not change the ownership of any other properties, nor will it change verb ownerships.  Use @grant if you need to do a more complete ownership change.  The quota of the former owner is increased by one, as is the quota of the new owner decreased by one.

<P>Changing a property ownership is truly hairy.  If the property is +c one should not be doing this, unless it is to correct a past injustice which caused the property to be owned by the wrong person.  In the case of -c properties, the property ownership is changed on all descendent objects (currently, if +c instances of a -c property are found in the traversal of all of the descendants, these are not changed, being deemed sufficiently weird that they should be handled on a case-by-case basis...).

<P>If there's any justice, a future version of the server will prevent occurrences of (1) +c properties being owned by someone other than the object owner (2) -c properties with different owners on descendant objects (3) -c properties that are +c on some descendants.

<P>NOTE:  Managers with "Ownership Transfers" responsibility can @chown objects, but not verbs or properties.  Managers with "Technical Support" responsibility can @chown all three.  Neither can @chown objects, verbs, or properties that are wizard-owned.

<P>If either &lt;note&gt; or &lt;list of characters, *mail-folders, or @classes&gt; is omitted, you will be prompted for an answer.  In any case, you will be prompted for a subject line for the message, and for any additional recipients you wish to add to your list.

<P>If you wish a character, mail-folder, or class to be specifically *omitted* then prefix it with a "!" character.

<P>Users can specify that they do not wish to receive any @massmail mailings by using the "no_mass_mail" user option:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;@useroption +no_mass_mail

<P>Currently available classes are: @everyone, @builders, @programmers, @wizards, @newbies, @professors, @vspos

<P><B>Example:</B> @massmail message to Jim *general @vspos
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@massmail to @everyone
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@massmail to @everyone !@vspos

<P>The last example sends the mail to everyone except VSPOs.

<P>Note that if recipients are specified explicitly, then they are sent the mail even if they are included in one of the classes specified as not to receive mail.  For instance, if Jim is a VSPO, then with 

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;@massmail message to Jim !@vspo

<P>Jim will still be sent a copy of the message since he was specified explicitly.  However, if Jim is a @builder and a VSPO, and 

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;@massmail message to @builders !@vspos

<P>Then Jim will not receive the message, since no VSPOs are to be sent a copy, and Jim wasn't specified explicitly.

<P>Synonym: @detoad

<P>Turns the object into a registered character. 
<BR>If the name/alias... specification is given, the object is also renamed.
<BR>In order for this to work, the object must be a descendant of $player but not a registered user character and the new object name (or the original name if none is given in the command line) must be available for use as a person's name.  As with ordinary user character @renaming, any aliases which are unavailable for use as character names are eliminated.

<P>If the object is a descendant of $guest, then it becomes a new guest character.
<BR>Otherwise the object is chowned to itself.  In the latter case, it is advisable to check that the .password property has something nontrivial in it.

<P>If the object is a descendant of $prog, then its .programmer flag is set.

<H2><A NAME="applications">applications</A></H2>

There are three commands for processing character requests.  All applications initially are sent to the *character-request-pool (*char) mail list where they are open to all wizards to read.  Character application evaluation requires one of three options: accept an application, reject it, or place it on a pile of undecided cases. There are three mail lists to hold each of the three sets of processed applications: *created, *rejected and *undecided.

<P>Accepting a request (with @create-character) will create the new character and set the notes, birthdate and hometown on the newly created character object. If the application was done by a VSPO, his/her character will be converted into a regular player object.    In either case, the application will be moved to *created.

<P>To subscribe initially to the character application system mail folders, use:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;@subscribe $request_pool
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;@subscribe $created_chars
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;@subscribe $rejected_chars
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;@subscribe $undecided
<BR>Note that once you are subscribed to them you can refer to them as *char, *created, *rejected, and *undecided.  

<P>Rejecting or being indecisive about an application will move it to the respective mail folders, i.e.  *rejected or *undecided.  Applications are moved to *undecided as indication that others should evaluate the application.

<H2><A NAME="blacklist">blacklist</A></H2>

The Site Blacklist

<P>$login maintains three lists of hosts/domains to support user registration schemes and blocking of connections from highly untrusted hosts:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;.redlist   - all connections from these sites are disabled 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;.blacklist - character creation and guest logins are disabled
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;.graylist  - advisory list of potential trouble spots (putting a site on the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.graylist merely annotates it in @net-who listings).
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;.spooflist - guests from these sites cannot use @request to request 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a character

<P>The lists are kept in a special format so it is highly recommended that you 
<BR>either use $wiz:@*list/@un*list or the following verbs to query/update the 
<BR>respective lists rather than bash them directly:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;$login:*listed     (host)              is host is on .*list?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;$login:*list_add   (domain or subnet)  add domain or subnet to .*list
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;$login:*list_remove(domain or subnet)  remove domain or subnet from .*list

<P>where `*' is one of `black', `red', `gray', or `spoof'.

<P>One may either specify a domain name (e.g., "baz.edu") or a numeric IP address (e.g., "36.0.23.17").  Domain names match all hosts underneath that domain, so, e.g., puting "baz.edu" on a list effectively adds "x.bax.edu" for all x as well.  
<BR>Likewise, an incomplete numeric address, e.g., "128.42" will match that entire subnet, in this case all hosts whose IP numbers have the form "128.42.m.n" for arbitrary integers m and n.

<P>One may also give a domain name containing a wildcard ("*"), e.g., "fritz*.baz.edu", in which case all hostnames matching in the sense of $string_utils:match_string() are considred to be on the list.  Wildcard matching should be avoided since it is more time-consuming.

<P>It should be noted that, since there is no direct access to the domain name service from within the MOO, it is possible for a host to be blacklisted or redlisted via its domain name, and yet have someone be able to connect from that host (and, in the case of a blacklisted host, create a character) - this can happen if the name service is down and connection_name() on that character's connection thus has given the numeric IP address rather than the domain name.  Similarly, if you list a host by IP number alone, it will still be possible to get in via the site's domain name.  Thus to be completely assured of shutting out a site, you need to list it both by domain name and IP number.

<P>Technical Support
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that in addition to the commands below, many routine MOO commands
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;give essentially wizardly access to Managers responsible for "technical
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;support."  This enables them to edit and modify most anything in the MOO
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;except for things that are wizardly or wizard-owned.
<BR><A HREF="manager_help.html#@tasks">@tasks</A> -- list queued tasks (like @forked but succinct)

<BR><A HREF="manager_help.html#@make-player">@make-player</A> -- create a character with its player-bit set (bypasses char. app. system)
<BR><A HREF="manager_help.html#@dusted">@dusted</A> -- displays all non-wizard owned objects that carry one or more wiz-permed verbs.

<BR><A HREF="manager_help.html#@rm-class-object">@rm-class-object</A> -- same, but remove one

<P>NOTE: MOO technician managers are also able to use @set and the Note Editor to change object property values when they don't own the property.

<P>There is a "general restriction" system for which Managers can have immunity (see `help $perm_utils:action_restricted').  In the eduCore by default, the only general restriction is on renaming characters, and managers with character application, access restriction, and technical responsibility are excepted, and can perform this renaming on others.
