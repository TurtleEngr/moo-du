<BR>Wizards PLEASE NOTE: Due to security considerations, additional-owners
for wizard-owned objects have additional restrictions. Specifically, reading
and setting individual properties as though one was the owner on wiz-owned
objects is not allowed. If you need to have others able to access properties
in this way, you must make your object owned by a non-wizard.

<A NAME="@check-for-core"></A>@check-for-core</H2>
Checks a core object for possible problems in its property initialization
or verb references which may exist if it is transferred to a new core DB.
The initcore_data property should initialize all properties to the form
they should be in a new core DB, and in particular remove any references
to non-core object numbers. (see 'help #1:initcore_data for details.) This
command checks to see if there are any syntax errors in the object's initcore_data,
and if the properties still have object numbers which are not on the core.
It also scans the verbs in the object for absolute object numbers and for
$names which may not be on a new core DB.

<P>Use: @check-for-core &lt;name>
<BR>or: @check-for-core &lt;core id>

<P>where &lt;core id> is the object's unique name in its unique_id[1] (see
'help unique-id').

<P>Additional comands for core object testing are available as feature
verbs on $core_utils. See 'help $core_utils' and '@about $core_utils' or
'@mailme $core_utils' for details.

Wizard Notes
<BR>------ -----

<P>The "@add-class" and "@add-class-object" commands are available for
adding a new class (catagory) or object to a class, to be displayed by
@classes.

<P>The @classes command uses the values in #0.class_registry ($class_registry).
$class_registry is in the following format:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; { {name, description, members}, ... }
<BR>where `name' is the name of a particular class of objects, `description'
is a one-sentence description of the membership of the class, and `members'
is a list of object numbers, the members of the class.

<A NAME="@core-id"></A>@core-id</H2>
@core-id &lt;object>

<P>Gives information identifying a core object. This can be used either
to check if a given object is part of the base core or a core option, or
to get the object number for a given core id name. If given the object
name, outputs the object's unique ID. If given a core id name, the object
number and name is displayed. Also indicates whether this object can be
referenced by $&lt;name>.

See: <A HREF="core_help.html#core-options">core-options</A> in Core Utility

<H2>
<A NAME="@corify"></A>@corify</H2>
@corify makes an object part of the base core database or a selected core
option. Updates all databases which keep track of core objects or core
option sets. Optionally adds it as a property of #0 so it can be referenced
by $(name).

<P>Use: @corify &lt;object> as [$]&lt;name> [&lt;core-option>]

<P>where &lt;object> is the object number of a name found by my_match_object,
&lt;name> is the unique ID of the object which must be different from any
other core or core option object, the $ prefix is used if the object ID
is also to be a property on #0, and &lt;core-option> is the core options
set if this object is to be a part of an option rather than the base core.
See also 'help unique-id'.

<P>Note that once corified, the object can be referenced by &amp;&lt;name>.
This is useful for referencing objects on linked sites using the DUcore
because it is independent of the object number.

<P>The @uncorify command is used to remove an object from the base core
database or a core option, to remove it's unique ID, and remove all references
to its name to the registered name data base. This should be done before
any such object is recycled or replaced by another object which is to replace
it in the core db.

<P>Use: @uncorify &lt;object>

<P>NOTE that the core extraction system at this MOO differs from that on
the standard LambdaCore. In particular, an object number reference on #0
is no longer sufficient for it to be part of the core. Also, if you omit
the "$" ahead of the &lt;name> when using @corify, then the object will
NOT be added as an object number reference on #0. See '@about $core_utils'
or '@mailme $core_utils' for details.

This verb allows MOO administrators to set whether a MOO character or mail
folder is allowed to send or receive email directly from the Internet,
through the Internet Email Permeability System.
<BR>The two allowable values for &lt;access> are: send, recieve
<BR>This value can be prefixed with `!' to indicate access is restricted.
<BR>To allow the MOO user "Jane" to receive direct Internet email, you
would use:
<BR>&nbsp; @email-access Jane is receive
<BR>To restrict John from sending direct Internet email, use:
<BR>&nbsp; @email-access John is !send
<BR>Omitting the &lt;access> reports the current email permeability access

<TD VALIGN=TOP>@manager &lt;person> for &lt;responsibility></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
This command makes someone's character a child of the $manager class (or
removes them from it), and also assigns and removes specific responsibiltiies
from the set of those available for Managers. The responsibility can be
specified just with enough of a prefix to be unambiguous.

<P>If you don't specify a responsibility, you'll be told which responsibilities
the person already has and which are available. Specifying "nothing" as
the responsibility will remove the person from the Manager class entirely.
Specifying a responsibility with "!" prefixed means to remove that responsibility
from the person.

<P>Note that some abilities apply to all Managers, and there is no setting
for them. These include: @shout.

<P>Assignable responsibilities are:

<P>nothing - if the person isn't already a Manager, this makes them a Manager
but with no areas of responsibility assigned. If the person is a Manager,
then all areas of responsibility are removed. Note that the @unmanager
command is used to remove someone's Manager status completely.

<P>character applications - the Manager can access the *character-request-pool.
*created, *reject, and *undecided mail folders and use @created and other
commands to process character applications.

<P>VSPO management - the Manager can create and destroy VSPO groups, as
well as perform VSPO group management functions on any group.

<P>builder management - the Manager can confer or remove builder permissions,
and also can set people's building quota.

<P>programmer management - the Manager can confer and remove programmer
permissions (progbits).

<P>rooms and exits - the Manager can add and remove exits from any MOO
room, allowing them to manage MOO building activities.

<P>ownership transfers - the Manager can transfer objects from one person's
ownership to another. Note this gives @recycle ability indirectly.

<P>access restrictions - the Manager can control user access functions
including @unlock-account, @boot, and @newt.

<P>server management - the Manager has permission to shutdown and force
checkpoint backups of the MOO.

<P>Administration and policy - the Manager has responsibility for DU MOO
administration and policy development. Note this doesn't provide access
to any new commands, and is strictly for informational purposes.

<A NAME="@register-name"></A>@register-name</H2>
@register-name is used to assign a unique_id name to a non-core object.
The name reference then goes on $id. (Using "ID" as the core-option in
@corify has the same effect.) The object can then be referenced by '&amp;&lt;name>',
and it can also be referenced on a linked site using the DUcore, provided
that the @register-name command was also executed at that site. If the
object was previously @corified, it is removed from the core or core option
it was part of previously, if applicable.

<P>Use: @register-name &lt;object> as [$]&lt;name>

<P>where &lt;object> is the name or object number of an object, &lt;name>
is the unique ID of the object which must be different from any other core
or core option object, the $ prefix is used if the object ID is also to
be a property on #0.

<B>Notes for Wizards:</B>

<P>&nbsp; Wizards have the additional requirement of adding a help text
to the appropriate database for all command line verbs on generic user
characters. See "@kids $generic_help" for the list of databases.

<P>&nbsp; Such verbs should NOT have any header lines, but instead be solely
documented through the help database system. This is because the Undocumented
Help System ($undoc_help) will find help in both places and ask the user
which they wish to see. Just put all the documentation (except internal
verb comments) in a help database text.

<P>&nbsp; It is VITAL that help texts have a format that allows them to
be properly extracted for HTML format, which means that they should follow
the format given below. Note that help texts for other than commands don't
need to fit the format given, but *do* need to follow the rule that a double-hyphen
may only be used to demarcate a reference to another help topic. The format
for help database entries is as follows:
<BR>__________
<TABLE BORDER=0 >

<BR>__________
<TABLE BORDER=0 >
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Syntax:</B></TD>

<TD VALIGN=TOP>The titles given (e.g. "" or "Related Topics") are not suggestions!
These are keys scanned for by the system that extracts the eDUcore manual
(all the help texts) and if you don't use them exactly, it creates errors
in the extracted manual. An example of two types of Usage is "@eject" and
"@eject!" where the varients have slightly different effects. The "Example"
line is optional, and only needed when the "Usage" line is complex. Multiple
"Usage" and "Example" lines may be used when appropriate.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
The blank lines after "Syntax" and "Synonyms" (and any other section) are
significant to the HTML extraction system that prepares the eDUcore manual,
so be sure to include those. In general, you should not `fill' the text
to divide it into lines broken by return characters. Instead, make each
paragraph a single long line, and separate them with an blank line. This
leads to far better HTML versions of the help texts. If MOO users need
line wrapping, they have other mechanisms to do that.

<P>When creating a multi-part help text across several help databases,
add a "Notes for &lt;class>" line followed by a blank line (see this text
as an example). This indicates to the user that the following text applies
specifically to a certain &lt;class> of character (e.g. Wizards, Managers,
etc.). The &lt;class> should be derived from the class that the particular
help text database is for.

<P>&nbsp; IMPORTANT: Note the two hyphens after the &lt;help topic> in
the "Related Topics" section. The automatic hypertext help system uses
these to identify command names that can be used to point to addition help
texts, and assumes that left of the double hyphen is a single word that
is itself a valid help topic. Use a single &lt;help topic> per line. Never
use a double hyphen in a help text *except* to demarcate a related help
topic!!

<P>where &lt;access> is one of readers, writers, moderators, or

<BR>responsibility (property names on $manager ending in "_ok"). If you
