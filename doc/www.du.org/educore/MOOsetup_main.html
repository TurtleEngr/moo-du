<A NAME="MOOsetup_introduction"></A>Introduction</H2>
Although many schools are learning about the appeal of using multi-user,
online, virtual reality worlds for education, few have the local expertise
to establish one of their own. For this reason, Diversity University has
prepared this document and established a service program that provides
help at many levels to organizations wishing to use VR world systems to
supplement their educational programs. Such assistance can range from simply
providing consulting services, to having our staff establish and maintain
the VR world for you with your guidance on policy matters. The Diversity
University staff first developed its skills through administering its own
Diversity University Main Campus, running now for more than four years.
The DU Main Campus has become the premier site for teachers seeking to
learn more about using online VR worlds for education, and has served hundreds
of classes as the first VR world to which teachers have brought their students.
Diversity University offers both free and reasonably priced services to
aid all organizations seeking to use online VR worlds for education. DU
also provides the "eDUcore," a core database that may be used to establish
a virtual world, and that is available free for schools and other non-commercial
users.

<P>A person or group wishing to establish an online VR world must be familiar
with the requirements for this process, in order to judge the scale of
the project and determine where they might desire assistance from Diversity
University staff. Therefore, this document describes the steps required
for establishing an online virtual reality world. The virtual world system
presented here is based on "MOO" software, using the LambdaMOO Server along
with Diversity University's eDUcore database. The eDUcore provides numerous
features especially designed for educational use, and supports a multimedia
Web-based interface as well as the regular text-based system. This document
supplements a related and excellent text, "<A HREF="http://english.ttu.edu/kairos/1.3/2a.html">Reflections
Onna MOO</A>" (not by Diversity University), that is written for people
who will be setting up such a system entirely on their own. In this text,
it is assumed that Diversity University will be assisting you in some capacity
with settin up the virtual world system. It therefore describes where DU
can provide assistance, where you may want your own personnel to perform
some functions, and where your direct participation is critical. Although
written as a guide to people who will be having DU assist them, it provides
a complete outline of steps and guidelines for policy development, which
may be of use to anyone establishing a MOO-based virtual world system.

<P>It is assumed here that you already have some basic familiarity with
MOO systems, including having visited a MOO and possibly having created
some rooms or other objects. Several introductory texts are available elsewhere
for those completely new to using MOOs. Also, it is assumed that the initial
administration of the MOO will be by personnel with experience in managing
an online virtual world of this type. Administrators may be provided by
Diversity University during the period when your own staff will be receiving
training as administrative assistants, be provided by DU on an ongoing
basis to some degree, and be drawn from your own personnel who have the
needed experience in administering a MOO-based VR world. Administrative
assistants can be given incremental access to managerial tools as their
training proceeds, and as they assume more administrative responsibilities.

<P>We'll proceed by listing the critical steps for founding an online virtual
world, and then expand upon each individually in turn. For each step, we
will identify the questions that you must answer and the issues that must
be settled to complete that step. The critical steps to be performed by

<H2>
<A NAME="MOOsetup_1"></A>Perform a General Needs Assessment, and Develop
a Schedule and Service Plan</H2>
The key element of this very first step is to identify the goals and purpose
behind establishing the online VR world. Simply creating a virtual space
so that people can explore what is possible there will not lead to constructive
use of this powerful medium to support your overall educational program.
As with any significant educational project, you must identify your needs
and goals, establish a schedule, and, if you wish to have DU assist you,
arrange a service plan. Diversity University is available to assist you
in each of these areas, drawing on its staff's strong experience in exactly
these matters.

<P>Schools have used online VR worlds for many different purposes, sometimes
establishing them for a single specific function and in other cases seeking
to explore the widest possible range of applications. Some examples of
purposes for which VR worlds have been used are:
<UL>
<LI>
Provide an office hours location for teachers and teaching assistants.</LI>

<LI>
Promote community development among your school's teachers and/or students.</LI>

<LI>
Provide a virtual world environment for students to develop class projects.</LI>

<LI>
Showcase the work done by the school's teachers and students.</LI>

<LI>
Provide teacher professional development services online.</LI>

<LI>
Offer a medium for developing interpersonal connections between the school's
community, other schools, and other outside communities.</LI>

<LI>
Provide an interactive, multi-user learning environment for students to
explore educational exhibits created by students, teachers, and professional
developers.</LI>
</UL>
This list is not exhaustive, and new frontiers in the application of online
VR worlds to education are being continually explored. In fact, an additional
purpose for such systems at many schools is to research new ways in which
such environments may be used effectively to support learning. Identifying
specific initial and long-term goals for your program is critical, because
they will form the basis for the theme, structure, policies, and pedagogical
philosophy underlying all that happens in the VR world.

<P>Once the purposes for establishing a VR world are clearly identified,
it is appropriate to develop a plan and a schedule for proceeding. This
document is intended to identify the tasks that need to be performed, and
to give some guidelines on how much time they are likely to take. However,
any reasonable schedule is closely tied to the commitment of time and other
resources by the people who are responsible for the project. Establishing
a realistic schedule will help insure that tasks are performed correctly,
help the project build momentum, and promote a successful outcome. You
can generally expect to spend at least three weeks and up to eight weeks
or more determining the goals, developing a plan, and establishing the
policies you will require to establish a successful virtual world for education.
Diversity University can assist you in these matters.

<P>Some questions you should answer include:
<UL>
<LI>
How many students, teachers, administrators and other online support staff
do you expect to be using the virtual world after, one, three, six and
twelve months?</LI>

<LI>
What will be the composition and former online experience of the teachers
and administrators using the virtual world?</LI>

<LI>
Is suitable hardware availale for supporting the size the virtual world
will reach within one year?</LI>

<LI>
How much help with using the virtual world system will teachers provide,
and how much will be performed by the online support staff?</LI>

<LI>
Will the virtual world serve primarily to suppliment regular courses, be
a type of extra-curricular activity, form the basis for a distance-learning
system, or perhaps serve in several of these roles?</LI>

<LI>
Will students only be using the online system as part of a course, with
a set term, or will they be allowed to retain their online character and
continue using and extending the virtual world afterwards?</LI>

<LI>
Will people other than those at your institution be allowed permanent or
temporary characters in the virtual world?</LI>

<LI>
What should the general characteristics be of the community that you wish
to see develop within the VR world?</LI>

<LI>
Should an effort be made to attract teachers and students to the virtual
world who are not already part of the planned program?</LI>

<LI>
Who will be responsible for making final policy decisions and how will
conflicts between people over activities within the virtual world be resolved?</LI>
</UL>
Once a schedule is determined, you should arrange for Diversity University
to provide assistance in any areas you feel would benefit from this. By
preparing an arrangement in advance, you insure that our staff will be
at your side when you need them to lend their experience and help.

<HR WIDTH="100%">
<H2>
<A NAME="MOOsetup_2"></A>Identify a Theme and Underlying Pedagogical Philosophy
for the VR World</H2>
This step is the one most often forgotten or performed in a cursory fashion
by those unfamiliar with the needs of using online virtual reality worlds
for education. Unfortunately, it is probably the one most critical for
the long-term success of such a project. There have been too many such
programs established with high hopes, only to languish due to unfocused
goals, a poor match between theme and purpose, ignorance of effective pedagogical
methods for online education, and absent or even destructive policies.
There is no good reason for this besides ignorance, and careful attention
to this step will insure your VR world has a strong foundation for growth.

<P>A critical aspect of the VR world's foundation is determining the pedagogical
philosophy or philosophies that it will follow. The two major philosophies
that most online VR worlds have been established to follow are either the
traditional lecture/discussion/textbook methodology, or a constructivist
approach. Both of these may be applied within a single VR world, but it
is important that teachers be made aware of the implications of both in
order to chose the most suitable methodology for a particular application.

<P>The advantage of using the traditional teaching methodology in the virtual
world environment is its familiarity to teachers and students. Most of
the elements of traditional teaching may indeed be carried into virtual
space. Note, however, that lectures are typically not suitable for text-based
conferencing environments like MOOs, as the absence of a physical speaker
tends to make this format (even) less engaging for students. Virtual worlds
may be used to support the traditional lecture/discussion methodology by
presenting pre-established learning materials to students, generally as
exhibits. Such material must be prepared in advance by students, teachers,
or professional developers like Diversity University. Simulations, in which
the student learns by walking through and interacting with the exhibit,
are made more exciting by the multi-user nature of the virtual world system.
Teachers can lead classes through such exhibits, and use them as a basis
for promoting discussion and other deeper exploration of the subject material.
The major drawback of the traditional methodology is that it may not promote
full involvement by all students in the learning process.

<P>Probably the most exciting application of MOOs in education has been
their use as the most effective constructivist learning environment yet
identified. The system has the ability to provide a virtual space for students
to create simulations and other projects based on material learned both
in class and independently. In seeking to create virtual spaces that are
accurate reflections of the underlying material, students are driven to
ask and answer critical questions, which many believe leads to more effective
learning. Although some online VR worlds are used for both traditional
and constructivist pedagogical methods, most experienced teachers recommend
the latter as the most effective application of this new medium. The main
drawback of the constructivist methodology is that it is sometimes unfamiliar
with teachers and students, and can require the teacher to spend more time
with individual students (which can be prohibitive in a large class).

<P>The theme and structure of the virtual world establishes the basic tone
of the environment, and permeates every activity that goes on inside. For
instance, at one extreme such worlds have been established to simulate
a particular school's physical campus, providing a virtual space to exactly
parallel the physical space. The underlying statement is that the virtual
world is an extension of the school into an area that happens to have somewhat
different "physical" properties, but is essentially the virtual reflection
of the physical school. On the other hand, virtual world's have been established
that either correspond to some nonexistent but realistic environment (e.g.
a forest clearing), have a basis somewhat in fantasy (e.g. a space station),
or have no physical equivalent (e.g. spaces with more than three dimensions,
or structured in other physically impossible forms). Many hybrid forms
are also possible. The theme and structure must be sufficiently flexible
to accomodate all the activities for which the virtual world is likely
to be used, while promoting the organization of its elements in a functional
manner.

<P>The degree to which the virtual world incorporates physically possible
or impossible reality, and appears like a traditional or unusual learning
environment, can send a strong message to its users about how closely the
educational projects done there are expected to conform to traditional
work. Generally, one should avoid either extreme, although there is probably
a place for every possible design. Once established, it is not generally
possible to restructure the major structures of the VR world, so careful
consideration of the central layout is essential.

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<H2>
<A NAME="MOOsetup_3"></A>Establish the Policies That Will Govern the Virtual
World's Community Development</H2>
Another critical aspect of preparing your educational VR world program
is the establishment of policies that will govern its administration and
growth. Since these policies have an important role in setting the tone
for the community, they must be carefully crafted to effectively support
the goals of the program. The primary questions that such policies must
address are listed below.
<H3>
Who will be permitted to have a character in the VR world?</H3>

<DIR>Will characters be granted only to support staff, teachers and students
at your school? Will they be restricted to members of your department and
students currently enrolled in your courses? Will people from outside your
school be invited to develop projects in your virtual world? Will guest
access, using temporary characters not assigned to any particular person,
be allowed? Is guest access to be only allowed from sites on your school's
network?</DIR>

<H3>
Who will be given a permanent character and who will get a temporary one?</H3>

<DIR>Although regular registered characters are permanent unless specifically
destroyed, the eDUcore provides a system for temporary characters that
are automatically destroyed at a pre-established time. Objects that they
have created may optionally be destroyed at that time also, or their ownership
transferred to a permanent character. This system (the "VSPO" system) is
commonly used to provide characters for students in a particular course
with an established term. Groups of VSPO characters are assigned to teachers,
who are able to initialize them and are provided with many administrative
abilities that are normally available only to the VR world administrators.
Such administrative abilities for VSPO group owners may only be used specifically
otward VSPO characters for whom the owner is responsible.</DIR>

<H3>
What behaviors are not acceptable in the virtual world, and how will they
be identified and resolved?</H3>

<DIR>The freedom from many physical restrictions typically lends a certain
exuberance to teachers and students working in this new medium. They may
rightly question which regular rules and manners should apply to a space
without the usual physical limits. It is your responsibility to provide
a clear and flexible set of guidelines to insure that the VR world is used
appropriately and effectively. You may with to review the DU Main Campus
Manners Policy as an example, and the @witness and @knock systems in the
eDUcore.</DIR>

<H3>
Who will be permitted to build rooms and objects in the VR world, and what
requirements if any must they satisfy?</H3>

<DIR>Although virtual space is apparently endless, rooms and other objects
created in a VR world take up real space in RAM and disk memory on the
computer where the world is running. Since such resources are typically
limited, you will want to carefully regulate the growth of the virtual
world. Often, the primary guidelines for developing such regulations is
that work done in the VR world must be themely, must promote the purpose
of the program, and that student work should be destroyed at the end of
the course if it is not to be specifically retained to showcase the class's
projects. This last policy can be enforced through features of the eDUcore's
VSPO system.

<P>You must determine who will be allowed to build in the virtual world,
how much building quota they will be given initially, and how they should
request more quota from either administrators or from the teacher controlling
their VSPO group if they have a temporary character. Note that the eDUcore
provides either byte-based quota, which measures the actual space in memory
taken up by objects, or object-based quota, which simply counts the number
of objects a person owns. It is critical that either one or the other is
chosen in advance for the entire virtual world, since it is complicated
to change this later.</DIR>

<H3>
What are the rules to which builders must adhere to insure the theme and
purpose of the VR world is maintained?</H3>

<DIR>Builders must be given guidelines to insure that work created in the
virtual world furthers the purpose for which it was established. In addition,
if you have established certain rules concerning the structure of the world
and its expansion, these must be clearly conveyed to your community and
applied fairly.</DIR>

<H3>
What are the conditions and procedures for obtaining permission for and
performing MOO programming?</H3>

<UL>Although users of the virtual world are able to create their own rooms
and other objects from preexisting templates called "generic" objects,
these will have only the behaviors and functions that the template provides.
If new behaviors are desired, they must be added using the MOO programming
language.</UL>

<UL>Only people who have specifically been given programming privileges
by a VR world administrator are able to perform programming. The reason
is that programmers are somewhat able to disrupt activities in the virtual
world to a limited extent, and possibly cause certain malicious damage
within it. Although the system's security functions typically limit this
to only causing annoyance, it is nevertheless a potential source of disruption.
For this reason, many academic virtual worlds allow only responsible and
trusted individuals to have programming privileges, and only after or along
with some kind of instruction to prevent them from causing problems accidentally.
In accordance with this need, a policy must be developed to describe how
community members may obtain permission to do programming.</UL>

<H3>
What are the roles of administrators, assistant administrators, and technical
support staff in managing the virtual spaces and the community?</H3>

<DIR>Three different types of administrative roles are available in an
eDUcore-based virtual world. One is for "VSPO group owners," who are generally
teachers that are given a set of temporary VSPO characters to be distributed
to their students. VSPO group owners have a set of administrative tools
available to help them in managing their classes. Generally, you can leave
the administration of such groups to the teachers, but you should establish
some sort of guidelines regarding the conditions under which teachers should
give building ability and quota, and programming ability, to their students.
Teachers typically share in the responsibility for insuring their students
obey the VR world's policies.

<P>Secondly, there are "wizards" who generally serve a technical support
role, although they may also have administrative responsibilities. "Wizards"
are able to modify and access everything in the virtual world, and in some
cases can access resources outside the virtual world on the computer where
the system is running. Careless or malicious actions by a wizard can damage
the virtual world severely, requiring reversion to a backup copy of the
database and possibly causing significant amounts of work to be lost. For
this reason, only the most trusted, experienced, and responsible people
should be given wizard characters.

<P>Finally, "manager" characters are given the ability to perform the administrative
tasks required for day-to-day operation of the virtual world. The eDUcore
system provides a set of "areas of responsibility," one or more of which
may be assigned to a manager, that provide access to the tools needed for
fulfilling such responsibilities. Because managers typically have limited
security-related abilities, the risks associated with giving someone a
wizard character apply to a much lesser extent, so students and teachers
without the technical expertise needed to safely be an effective wizard
may be assigned manager characters if you wish. Different areas of responsibility
require different commitments of time, and have different degrees of security
risk associated with them, so a careful match between the person and their
responsibilities is needed. Sometimes, the term "administrators" is useful
to refer to people who have been given access to all the managerial tools,
while "administrative assistants" can refer to those given only a subset
of responsibilities and abilities.</DIR>

<H3>
Who are appropriate individuals to provide the administrative and technical
support services the VR world requires, and how are they to be chosen?</H3>

<DIR>A review of the areas of responsibility available for managers will
help you determine which of your available personnel would be appropriate
for different roles. The "manager-summary" topic of the eDUcore's internal
help system provides a complete list of managerial tools and the areas
of responsibility that include them. If you are going to be recruiting
administrative assistants from the student population, you may want to
establish some guidelines for how students may request and be given status
as an administrative assistant.</DIR>

<H3>
What policy texts must be written, where should the be found in the virtual
world, and how will people be informed of their existence and application?</H3>

<DIR>Policies may be presented as note objects in the virtual world, extensions
of the help database system, as outside Web pages, or in several formats.
The text initially sent to people who are granted new characters should
include instructions on how to find such written policies.</DIR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">
<H2>
<A NAME="MOOsetup_4"></A>Develop a Central Floor Plan for the VR World,
Providing the Public Spaces to Which User-Generated Extensions Will Be
Added</H2>
Once the basic theme of the VR world has been established, you will need
to create a central floor plan. The spaces that constitute the initial
world must reflect the theme, but also provide sites where extensions of
the VR world may be added both as additional public spaces and also for
class projects. The fact that hallways and other passages may be infinitely
extended provides a simple mechanism for expansion of the virtual world,
but such passages should be easy to find and navigate.

<P>Organization of the virtual world's spaces is critical if people are
to be able to find significant resources by walking through the virtual
world, as is commonly desired. This "walking" system, using rooms and exits,
is often supplemented by a variety of "teleporting" systems. Teleporting
systems include the "@go" and "@rooms" systems in the eDUcore, as well
as any of a variety of "teleporting doors" that can take people directly
to rooms that would be several walking steps away within the world's basic
layout.

<P>Virtual world structures that will have physically impossible structural
aspects must be carefully evaluated in terms of ease of use. Your community
members can't use the excellent materials you've provided if they aren't
able to find them.
<H2>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></H2>

<H2>
<A NAME="MOOsetup_5"></A>Determine if Any Supporting MOO Objects Not Provided
with the eDUcore Will Be Required</H2>
In general, the eDUcore supplies all the "generic" objects (i.e. templates)
and tools needed to establish a virtual world for education. In some cases,
your community members (both teachers and administrators) will have previous
experience with MOOs and desire that particular tools that they've used
elsewhere be available in your virtual world. Permission to "port" such
objects and tools to your world must be established in advance with the
authors. Some such tools might be found at virtual worlds that DU operates,
in which case we can assist in contacting the authors and obtaining permission.

<P>In addition, you may desire some custom tools be developed for your
use. Organizations each have different needs and yours might require features
that the eDUcore doesn't normally provide. The Diversity University staff
includes experienced MOO software developers who can work with you to identify
your requirements and create MOO objects and tools to satisfy them. Such
custom programming is available at affordable rates.

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<H2>
<A NAME="MOOsetup_6"></A>Set Up the MOO Server, and Establish a Database
Backup and Technical Maintenance Plan</H2>
MOO systems have been established under many different UNIX operating systems
(including Linux), Windows 95 and NT, and the MacOS. Since the LambdaMOO
Server must generally be compiled for a specific UNIX system, if you are
using that OS then you'll need to have this task performed before you can
operate a MOO-based virtual world. Diversity University staff can do this
work for you, or provide consulting services to help you or your technical
support staff perform it. A pre-compiled version of the LambdaMOO Server
is available for Windows 95 and NT systems. Although a version of the LambdaMOO
Server compiled for the MacOS is available, DU does not have any experience
working with it, and few MOOs have been established using that operating
system. Obtaining and compiling a LambdaMOO server for a UNIX system and
setting up technical support mechanisms typically takes 2-4 hours, and
can be performed by DU staff.

<P>Note that Diversity University does not provide a copy of the LambdaMOO
Server, and it must be obtained from one of the sites where this software
is available. The server is required for running a MOO database, including
DU's eDUcore database. If Diversity University staff will be setting up
your MOO server, we can obtain a copy of it for you.

<P>As with all computer-based resources, certain technical support tasks,
including and especially making backup copies of files, must be performed.
Plans for regular backups of the MOO database, including tape and off-site
backups, must be established to insure the long-term health of your virtual
world. DU is able to provide on-going maintenance services for UNIX-based
systems, and appropriate consulting assistance, in conjunction with your
regular technical support staff.

<P>If you will be using the eDUcore's Web access system, you will generally
want to be able to use the "integrated interface," which requires that
you place a Java Telnet client on a Web server with the same address as
that of the virtual world. Note that because of security restrictions in
contemporary Web browsers, the Telnet client may only connect to resource
on the same server from which it is obtained. For this reason, the same
computer where the virtual world is running must also offer the Java applet
that provides a Telnet client, and there must be a Web server there to
send it.

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<H2>
<A NAME="MOOsetup_7"></A>Install a MOO Database, and Initialize Its Basic
Properties in Accordance with Local Requirements</H2>
Once a LambdaMOO Server is set up on your computer, you can obtain and
run an eDUcore MOO core database. Other databases are available, but Diversity
University recommends the eDUcore as we have developed it over many years
specifically for educational usages. Once loaded, there are several properties
in the new virtual world that must be initialized to conform with your
local hardware, network, and established policies. Also, the MOO's web
support system must be configured. In the eDUcore, there is a "setup" note
describing these procedures in the room where you will first connect to
the virtual world. This process usually takes 1-3 hours and can be performed
by DU staff.

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<H2>
<A NAME="MOOsetup_8"></A>Build the Rooms and Other Objects of the Central
Floor Plan</H2>
At this point, your virtual world is ready for use, and the first task
is to establish the basic layout that you previous determined will provide
the initial public spaces. Rooms must be built and descriptions added,
and multimedia resources must be attached as needed. Diversity University
staff can perform this task or assist you with it as needed.

<P>If tutorial rooms or other objects providing general assistance to the
virtual world community are to be available, they must also be created
and placed appropriately.

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<H2>
<A NAME="MOOsetup_9"></A>Process Applications From Administrators, Administrative
Assistants, and Teachers, to Create Their Virtual World Characters</H2>
The eDUcore includes a "character application" system, by which a person
may connect as a guest and request a permanent character be created for
her or his use. The application system asks a series of questions, and
posts the completed questionnaire to an internal mail-folder where administrative
personal can review and either approve or reject it. A character is automatically
created upon application approval. You will need to decide what questions
should be on the application, as this information will remain associated
with the newly created character, and may be useful for your administrators
and for better understanding the composition of your online world's community.

<P>Processing character applications is one of the areas of responsibility
to which a manager may be assigned. DU staff can serve this role early
in the project and train your staff to use the character application system,
or perform this task on a long-term basis.

<A NAME="MOOsetup_10"></A>Train Administrators and Administrative Assistants
in the Use and Management of the VR World</H2>
A virtual world is not a simple system. It is best thought of as a city,
with analogues to infrastructure, administration, and community services,
all of which must be established and operated effectively if the community
is to flourish. Your policies and choice of administrators will determine
if these requirements are successfully fulfilled. Diversity University
is able to provide experienced administrative staff, both to train your
own personnel and to provide long-term administrative support or consulting.
It is strongly suggested that you begin your project with at least one
highly experienced MOO administrator.

<P>Administrative tasks include such functions as:
<UL>
<LI>
Reviewing and processing character applications.</LI>

<LI>
Granting builder and programmer abilities to suitable permanent characters.</LI>

<LI>
Granting additional builder quota to permanent characters as appropriate.</LI>

<LI>
Creating VSPO groups of temporary characters for teachers to give to their
students.</LI>

<LI>
Attaching public spaces to rooms people have created.</LI>

<LI>
Monitoring the technical functions of the MOO server and database.</LI>

<LI>
Transferring ownership of objects between characters as appropriate.</LI>

<LI>
Monitoring the security of the virtual world system.</LI>

<LI>
Determining compliance of people's work with the theme and purpose of the
virtual world.</LI>

<LI>
Settling conflicts between community members regarding activities in the
virtual world.</LI>

<LI>
Answering questions and providing other assistance to people regarding
how to use the virtual world systems.</LI>

<LI>
Promoting positive developments and helping develop projects that further
the program's goals.</LI>
</UL>
This is certainly not an exhaustive list of administrative tasks, and the
roles of the virtual world administrators and the complexity of their tasks
expands with the community. Diversity University's experienced staff can
provide administrative services for your newly established virtual world,
and train your own staff in performing some or all of these functions as
needed. In addition, DU may be retained for long-term administration, consulting,
and other services. Most virtual worlds will need at least one and up to
four months of relatively close monitoring by experienced administrative
staff, before administrative assistants can confidently assume full responsibility
for at least some of the required tasks.

<P>In addition, the presence of helpful staff members to provide assistance
to new users of the virtual world can play a tremendous role in developing
the confidence and effectiveness of your virtual world's community members.
Such assistance can help a virtual world program gain momentum quickly,
or conversely, the lack of such support can so dismay teachers and students
that they conclude the virtual world system not a useful medium for learning.
For this reason, we recommend that you have at least one experienced person
online in the world for as much time as possible in the early stages of
the program, to provide basic assistance to people when they visit, and
help them become comfortable with the virtual world environment. DU staff
can serve in this role at very reasonable rates, or provide such assistance
at the outset and train your own staff to provide this service.

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<H2>
<A NAME="MOOsetup_11"></A>Train Teachers in the Use of the System, Including
the Tools Especially Provided for Student Management, and Provide an Appropriate
Pedagogical Background</H2>
As in other major educational projects, providing adequate training and
support for teachers is absolutely critical. If your teachers are not enthusiastic
and well prepared, the students will of course immediately perceive this
and all subsequent development of the program will have to work against
this. For this reason, most schools initiate a educational program using
virtual worlds with a small development group of teachers who are particularly
enthusiastic about using this medium. This also provides a chance to test
your policies against actual circumstances, and develops a group of teachers
and students from which future administrative assistants and other helpers
may eventually be drawn. Peer-to-peer training and support is typically
critical for the successful growth of a virtual world's program, so your
initial group of teachers should understand they may be asked to help teachers
joining the program later.

<P>Teachers will need to be trained in each of four subjects:
<UL>
<LI>
Basic and intermediate virtual world system usage</LI>

<LI>
Building and setting up rooms and virtual objects</LI>

<LI>
Setting up and administering VSPO groups of student characters</LI>

<LI>
Effective pedagogical methods for teaching in online virtual worlds</LI>
</UL>
It is impossible to overstate the importance of providing teachers with
training in every one of these areas if your program is to succeed. In
addition, although your initial group of teachers may be able to provide
support for teachers joining the program later, those later teachers will
also benefit from formal training in each of these areas before turning
to their peers for ongoing assistance.

<P>Diversity University can provide experienced instructors for training
your teachers to effectively teach students online in virtual worlds. Our
staff includes teachers who have been doing exactly this for many years,
and who have trained others to emulate their success. Although later in
the program your own staff and teachers will have the experience necessary
to provide such training themselves, it is critical at the beginning of
the program that you secure expert staff to provide this training to your
initial group.

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<H2>
<A NAME="MOOsetup_12"></A>Process Applications From Other People Who Will
Be Getting Permanent Characters, and Create Groups of Temporary Characters
for Students</H2>
Once you have your administrators and the initial teacher group established,
you are ready to open the virtual world for general use. At this time,
other people who will be getting permanent characters should submit applications
using the virtual world's application system (through a "guest" character),
and teachers should inform administrators of how many VSPO groups they
will need, and how many student characters will be needed in each group.
Administrators will process the applications and create the VSPO groups
as required. Some teachers are likely to need assistance in setting up
their VSPO groups, and you should arrange for staff who can answer questions.

<P>The email message that goes out to people given new permanent characters
should provide a brief introduction to the virtual world's purpose and
policies, and describe how new community members can get assistance. In
the case of temporary VSPO characters, the VSPO group owner is responsibly
for insuring their students are able to find assistance.

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<H2>
<A NAME="MOOsetup_13"></A>Provide Initial Training to Students in Using
the Virtual World, Including Basic Usage, and, if Needed, in Building Objects
and Otherwise Extending the Environment</H2>
New students and other members of the virtual world community will require
some form of training in using the basic functions of the virtual world.
Although the built-in help database system provides a comprehensive resource,
and a useful way to learn about specific functions, some additional forms
of instruction through formal classes and self-directed tutorials are extremely
useful. In addition, although the basic usage of the virtual world for
text-based conferencing and accessing established resources are typically
learned quickly, additional training is usually required for advanced activities
such as building new rooms and objects, and using the MOO programming language
to create objects with new behaviors. Some of your community members are
likely to be highly self-motivated, and will expand their knowledge of
the virtual world system on their own, but others learn best when given
more directed instruction.

<P>During the initial four to eight weeks of the virtual world's opening,
you will probably want to arrange some formal classes in some or all of
the following areas:
<UL>
<LI>
MOO Basics - speech, navigation, and using common objects</LI>

<LI>
Intermediate MOO Systems - using editors, the mail system, and advanced
objects</LI>

<LI>
MOO Building - creating your own objects using preexisting templates</LI>

<LI>
MOO Programming - adding new behaviors to objects using the MOO programming
language</LI>
</UL>
Diversity University can provide staff who are experienced in providing
instruction in each of these areas. In addition, we can train your support
personnel in these areas, and they can in turn provide assistance to others.
We have found that teachers bringing classes into the virtual world for
the first time are very appreciative if an experienced staff member can
provide the basic training in using the system's resources for the class.
Providing such training is critical if students are to effectively use
the virtual world environment for learning.

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<H2>
<A NAME="MOOsetup_14"></A>Perform Day-to-Day Administrative Functions While
the Online Community is Early in Its Development</H2>
The first one to four months after the virtual world opens for use will
likely be a somewhat exciting but chaotic time. Many new people will be
joining your community, your policies will be tested against developing
circumstances and may need refining, and the virtual world's community
will be establishing its social character. Your own personnel will still
be expanding their understanding of how the virtual world system works,
as well as how to best utilize it.

<P>During this critical period, you may find it especially useful to have
experienced Diversity University staff perform the basic administrative
functions needed for supporting the virtual world. In the course of this
period, they can train your own staff in these tasks. Typically, the pressures
of a newly opened virtual world ease during this period, and a more relaxed
ongoing administrative environment will be achieved. Once this is established,
many schools will want their own staff to take over major roles in administrating
the virtual world, although DU's staff may be retained for some roles and
to provide ongoing consulting or other services.

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<H2>
<A NAME="MOOsetup_15"></A>Provide Regular Support and Consulting for Administrators
and Administrative Assistants, Teachers, and Students While the Online
Community is Early in Its Development</H2>
During the critical first one to four months of your virtual world's existence,
administrators from your staff will be learning the special needs of an
online community. During these early stages, it is important that your
virtual world's staff is properly trained, including knowing what kind
of problems to expect and how best to solve them. Leadership and management
skills will be tested, and your administrators will learn how to best help
the community to grow in accordance with the virtual world's purpose.

<P>Typically, a new virtual world will have a large population of inexperienced
community members, and lack a foundation of people with established skills
who are available to help those new to the environment. During this period
before peer-to-peer training and assistance is possible, it will be up
to the virtual world's staff and the teachers bringing classes online to
provide the guidance and training needed to insure effective use of the
virtual world for learning.

<P>Diversity University staff can provide a core of experienced personnel
that will both assist the members of your virtual world's community as
needed, and develop your own staff's expertise in handling the day-to-day
problems that arise. It is probably inevitable that unexpected circumstances
will arise as your teachers and students explore what it means to develop
a community online. Experience, communication skills, and understanding
are critical for promoting healthy development within the rapidly developing
society of a new virtual world, and an experienced staff can insure that
your project has a good start.

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<H2>
<A NAME="MOOsetup_16"></A>Provide Long-Term Consulting, Administration,
and Other Support for the Duration of the Virtual World Program</H2>
As your virtual world grows and its community develops, you will need to
expand your administrative support accordingly. In addition, there will
always be new teachers to train, students who will need an introduction
to using the virtual world system, and new administrators to replace those
leaving. Continuing education for instructors and students will help insure
the development and vitality of your program.

<P>Diversity University staff are available to assist in all the long-term
support functions required for maintaining your virtual world.

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<H2>
<A NAME="MOOsetup_conclusion"></A>Conclusion</H2>
As we hope you've seen, establishing a virtual reality world for education
is not simply a matter of installing software and teaching people to use
it (although those tasks are critical too). The invisible but critical
part of any such system is the community that inhabits it, and by developing
a theme, structure, and policies that are conducive to the growth of a
community that uses the virtual world effectively for education, you will
establish your virtual world as a success or not. This document was written
to help insure that all the small pieces of the mosaic are in place to
support a strong community and successful project.

<P>We at Diversity University hope that his document has helped you learn
more about establishing a successful online, virtual reality world for
education. This document, others like it, and our public mail-folders and
periodic training sessions at the DU Main Campus are all provided for free
to promote the use of these exciting new tools for teaching and learning.
As a nonprofit educational organization, Diversity University exists to
help schools, teachers, administrators, and learners of all sorts to find
out more about using online VR worlds, and our staff are eager to help
you with your own projects. We hope you decide to explore this new educational
medium, and find our services useful.
