Introduction</H2>
The Diversity University eDUcore (version 2.0) is a Web-enabled, multimedia,
integrated, virtual reality collaboration and learning environment. Based
on "MOO" virtual reality technology, it is the most advanced and complete
MOO core developed specifically for education. The eDUcore is derived from
the DU Main Campus MOO, which has been serving teachers and students since
1993. The eDUcore incorporates all the critical functions familiar to the
thousands of people who have made the DU Main Campus their chosen online
teaching and learning environment. Now, with the full public release of
the eDUcore, any school or other organization may establish its own Internet-based
virtual world. Licenses for the eDUcore are available without charge for
schools and other noncommercial users.

<P>The eDUcore provides instructors and students with:
<UL>
<LI>
A virtual reality learning environment that provides a simulated physical
space and programmable, interactive virtual objects, with independent support
for text-only, Web, or 3D VRML interfaces.</LI>

<LI>
Navigation among virtual rooms, each with its own appearance, functions,
and enclosed virtual objects.</LI>

<LI>
Extensive text-based conferencing features.</LI>

<LI>
A Web-based multimedia interface for cross-platform Internet access using
any advanced Web browser (Navigator, Internet Explorer, or Lynx).</LI>

<LI>
An extendable environment, in which teachers and students can easily create
and customize rooms and objects of their own.</LI>

<LI>
Templates for many virtual objects with behaviors particularly useful for
education (notice boards, slide projectors, etc.).</LI>

<LI>
Powerful administrative tools both for instructors and virtual world managers.</LI>

<LI>
Full source code for both core facilities and virtual objects, written
in the "MOO programming language" and accessible from within the virtual
world.</LI>

<LI>
Extensive support from <A HREF="http://www.du.org/">Diversity University,
Inc.</A>, the nonprofit organization responsible for developing the eDUcore.</LI>
</UL>
The DU Main Campus core was originally built upon the LambdaCore, but has
since been modified and enriched with numerous educational and administrative
tools prompted by the needs of teachers and students. However, the LambdaCore-compatibility
of all critical systems has been retained, in order to insure useful virtual
objects may easily be shared between other LambdaCore-based MOOs. Full
support for the original LambdaCore text-based interface is retained, while
the eDUcore's Web-based interface provides intuitive and graphical access.

<P>Diversity University is a nonprofit organization established to promote
the development and use of online tools for education. In addition to our
free online public campuses, including the DU Main Campus MOO, we provide
software, services, and training to teachers and schools using online virtual
reality environments for learning. Diversity University has provided the
eDUcore (release 1.0) to certain schools and other organizations since
1995, but is now making release 2.0 widely available for broad application
to online education.

<P>As with all MOO core databases, a MOO server must be obtained to run
the core. Documentation for the eDUcore includes complete instructions
for obtaining, compiling, and otherwise setting up a complete MOO system,
including a database and a server.

<P>Many of the advanced functions the eDUcore includes will also be made
available in the near future as packages for installation into existing
MOOs. Information about these will be available at Diversity University's
web site when they become available.

<H2>
Selected Features</H2>
The eDUcore includes numerous features that were specifically developed
to enhance the system's application to education. Most of these features
are unique to the eDUcore. Some of the eDUcore's advanced features are:
<H3>
BioGate Web System</H3>
The eDUcore was one of the two primary sites (along with BioMOO) where
the BioGate Web system for MOOs was developed. The BioGate system allows
the MOO to dynamically generate World Wide Web pages, which display the
up-to-the-second state of rooms and other objects in the MOO. Navigation,
issuing many commands, and virtual object set-up and manipulation may be
performed through hyperlinks and forms with the Web pages generated. The
BioGate system provides a familiar, intuitive, and graphical interface
for all MOO users. Most critically, MOO builders may attach to virtual
objects any graphic, sound, or other resources that can appear within a
Web page, making the MOO into a full multimedia graphical environment.
The MOO even can generate 3-dimensional VRML-based scenes, presenting the
virtual space in a fully immersive and navigable form. The eDUcore provides
not a "text-based" virtual reality, but one that is a completely graphical
VR environment. However, full access through the text interface is preserved,
insuring users with minimal hardware or who use speech synthesizers still
have complete use of the educational environment. The "Cup-O MUD" Telnet
applet, written in Java, was specifically designed for the eDUcore, and
provides a real-time link that may be embedded within a graphical Web browsers
display, and provides the MOO with a fully integrated, platform-independent,
Web-plus-Telnet interface.
<H3>
Manager System</H3>
A major weakness of traditional MOO cores is that the only administrative
character class is the "wizard" type, which has total security and administrative
access. As a result, even people with minor administrative roles could
accidentally cause damage to the MOO database through the inexperienced
use of wizardly functions. In the eDUcore, nearly all the administrative
functions have been moved to a "manager" class, which has adjustable areas
of responsibility, all of which can be fulfilled without "wizardly" security
access. This allows schools, for instance, to assign various administrative
tasks to students without having to give them complete security access.
Administrative areas of responsibility that may be assigned include: character
application processing and creation, public rooms and exits maintenance,
builder or programmer administration, object ownership transfers, and more.
<H3>
"VSPO" Groups</H3>
Educational MOOs used for teaching typically have instructors bring classes
online for a semester, during which time they complete class assignments
that include building rooms and other objects. The eDUcore has built-in
support for temporary characters that are recycled (optionally with their
owned objects also) at a specified date. In addition, these temporary characters
(called VSPO characters), are created in groups and assigned to an individual
who is then responsible for them. The VSPO group owner has various administrative
abilities limited to the characters in VSPO groups they own. Teachers owning
VSPO groups can give their students' VSPO characters builder or programmer
authorization, additional building quota (to an established limit), move
them all to a room together, and perform many other functions particularly
useful for teachers with classes.
<H3>
Advanced Room Variants</H3>
The eDUcore has a complete series of advanced room types that extend the
standard "$room" with all the most popular MOO features. These features
include "details" (including surface, furniture, and container types),
active atmosphere messages, teleporting rooms, and more. These are all
fully integrated with the eDUcore, supporting its advanced room security
features.
<H3>
Character Applications and Processing</H3>
The eDUcore has the most advanced character application and processing
system available today. Guests and VSPO characters may apply for a permanent
character and are automatically given an online form to complete. This
form may be customized to include research questions, contact information,
or any other data the administrators wish to collect. Administrators then
may review each application and accept or reject it, selecting among several
form letters (to which personal messages may be added) that may be sent
to the applicant. Information from the application form is retained in
association with the created character, providing administrators with access
to information that may be used for better understanding the composition
of the MOO community.
<H3>
Unrecycle System</H3>
A major flaw in most MOO systems is that once an object is "recycled" (destroyed
and made available for reuse as new object), it is permanently lost. This
can lead to accidental destruction of objects that represent weeks or months
of work, including a student's entire project for the semester. The eDUcore
contains an "unrecycle" system that retains recycled objects for 24 hours
in a form that allows them to be completely recreated by their original
owner or MOO administrators. No online educational environment should be
without this type of critical system.
<H3>
Room Security</H3>
The eDUcore includes a sophisticated room security system, that permits
room owners to screen which characters or other MOO objects are allowed
to enter, as well as the mechanisms they may use to enter (standard exit
walking, teleporting, etc.). Special "invite" and "knock" commands are
available to promote polite usage. These are integrated with the eDUcore
room security to allow room owners to invite specific people temporarily
past the room's security restrictions.
<H3>
Helpful Persons System</H3>
The sophisticated "helpful persons system" allows MOO users to be designated
as "official" helpful persons. The "helpme" command is available for sending
questions to the official helpful persons currently online. In addition
to a "basic" help category, many other categories of help may be established.
Helpers may indicate which categories of help they wish to receive messages
for, and the "helpme" command may optionally be used to specify the category
of help, restricting the question to being sent to only helpers registered
for that category.
<H3>
InterMOO Portal</H3>
The InterMOO Portal is a room that allows MOO users to "walk" to other
MOOs. Portals can be established for as many other MOOs as you wish, providing
a simple mechanism for networking several MOOs together. When a character
enters a portal, she or he is connected to the other MOO, which may be
located anywhere on the Internet, and can connect as a guest or registered
character there. After quitting that distant MOO, the user is ejected from
the portal, restoring him or her to the original MOO. More advanced inter-MOO
networking features are currently in development, and some are included
in a beta-test form with the eDUcore.
<H3>
Email Permeability</H3>
Diversity University and SRI International's "TAPPED IN" group have developed
an "email permeability" system that allows Internet email to both be sent
directly by MOO users and also received by their characters. In addition
to the usual "@send Jim" command for sending a "MOOmail" message to the
character named Jim, users can "@send jane@outside.school.edu" to send
mail directly to an Internet address. Also, if an outside UNIX mail-drop
is established for the MOO, the email permeability system can retrieve
Internet email addressed directly to MOO users (e.g. to Jim@moomail.ourmoo.edu).
The email permeability system installed in the eDUcore uses standard POP3
protocols to retrieve mail from its outside mail-drop, and then distributes
the mail to appropriate recipients. Similarly, MOO mail folders may be
established to send and receive Internet email, allowing them to serve
as in-MOO proxies for outside mail lists. The authorization to send or
receive Internet email directly may be regulated by the MOO administrators
individually, with access being given to all users or only specified classes
or individuals.
<H3>
Multiple Ownership of Objects</H3>
Every virtual object in an eDUcore MOO may have "additional owners" who
have access to most of the editing facilities for that object, including
the ability to edit its name, description, messages, and most behaviors.
This feature permits group development of individual objects within a project.
<H3>
Extensive Online Help</H3>
Every command available to eDUcore users is documented in the online help
system. Many of the original LambdaCore help texts have been rewritten
or extended to improve their clarity and usefulness. Keyword searching
through either the entire or limited segments of the help system is available.
The complete set of online help texts is also included with the eDUcore
as a set of HTML and PDF format documents that may be used to create printed
manuals.
<H3>
Disk-based Mail Option</H3>
Database growth is a serious concern for any long-term MOO, since increased
size can lead to slower operation and expensive memory usage. In-MOO mail,
both for characters and mail folders, is usually the single largest part
of a MOO's growth. The eDUcore incorporates a "disk-based mail" system
that moves all the mail outside the MOO database itself. This system uses
the BioMOO/Weizmann Institute's "File Utilities Package" (FUP) for MOO,
which allows mail to be written to external files and retrieved, in a manner
that is completely transparent to MOO users. The FUP system must be installed
into the MOO server for the disk-based mail system to function. However,
in-MOO mail is fully supported for servers without the FUP system installed.
<H3>
Many Generic Objects</H3>
Many "generic" objects are available as templates for builders to create
their own custom learning environment. In addition to objects that are
standard to all MOO cores, the eDUcore include everything from simple surfaces
to bookshelves, robots, several "feature objects," tutorial rooms, and
much more. These have all been developed specifically to support online
education.
