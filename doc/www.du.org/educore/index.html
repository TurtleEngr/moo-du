The Diversity University eDUcore MOO database is not yet publically released
at this time.  Limited public beta testing is currently underway, but no 
exact release date is available.  The eDUcore and associated texts will be 
found in the /educore/database directory.  At this time, only copies of 
the licenses under which it will be released, and the MS-Word format files 
for printed eDUcore manual sections, are available.

In the /educore/server/patches directory you will find the server patches 
that we recommend for use with the eDUcore, along with instructions for 
installing them.  These patches are provided courtesy of their authors, and 
are available here at DU's site only as a convenience.  Please see their 
respective authors concerning questions about the patches.

In the /educore/server/scripts directory you'll find the scripts that DU 
uses for running and managing it's own MOOs.  Some of these have been 
modified from original scripts available with the LambdaMOO server itself.
