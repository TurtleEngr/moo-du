<A NAME="introduction"></A>Introduction</H2>
This document describes the software and hardware that is required to operate
a MOO. Because little detailed research has been done on this subject,
the information provided is based on the experiences of people who have
run MOOs on various platforms. This writing is intended to allow those
who are interested in starting a MOO to figure out if their existing hardware
is sufficient, if it will need to be upgraded, or if new hardware needs
to be purchased. It also provides explanations for common hardware limitations,
to better illuminate the decision-making process. It is assumed that the
reader is already somewhat familiar with what a MOO is. This document is
provided as a service of <A HREF="http://www.du.org/">Diversity University</A>,
a nonprofit organization that promotes the use of online tools for education,
particularly multi-user VR worlds.

<P><A HREF="#contents">(to table of contents)</A>
<H2>
<A NAME="software"></A>What software do I need to run a MOO?</H2>
There are two basic components to any MOO: 1) a Database, which contains
a description of the virtual world, including all the objects and their
behaviors, and 2) a Server which reads and interprets the Database, allowing
interactions between MOO users and the Database. You will need to obtain
both a Database and a Server to operate a MOO.

<P>At this time, the only commonly used Server is the <A HREF="ftp://ftp.research.att.com/dist/eostrom/MOO/">LambdaMOO
Server</A>. This software was originally developed by Stephen White, then
developed for many years by Pavel Curtis, who has recently passed on the
development of the Server to Erik Ostrom. In addition, many other people
have contributed code to the primary developers, some of which has been
subsequently incorporated into the Server. The Server has thus been developed
as a community effort, led at any one time by a single person who ends
up writing most of the improved Server code, and also decides which features
and code donations will be incorporated in subsequent Server versions.

<P>In addition to the MOO Server, you will need an existing Database, containing
at least the core systems and object templates needed to start building.
When starting a MOO, one almost always uses a MOO "core" Database, which
is one that has not yet been customized by the creation of rooms, characters,
or other objects, but only has their templates (i.e. the "generic" versions
of such objects). A MOO core is essentially an empty place, typically with
a single starting room, within which you will build your VR world. A MOO
core is created by extracting out the essential parts (or destroying all
the non-essential parts) of an existing MOO. For this reason, nearly all
MOO cores are actually derived from an operating MOO world, and you can
often visit the MOO world that the core was derived from to gain some idea
of the type of place it is. Several MOO cores are available (these are
<A HREF="http://nowhere.org/not_yet_written.html">described elsewhere</A>),
each reflecting the philosophies and needs of the MOOs from which they
were derived.

<P>In addition to the software needed to run the MOO itself, you will greatly
benefit from using a dedicated MUD/MOO client for connecting to the MOO.
Many are available for every common operating system, and people each have
their own preferences. Summaries and descriptions of some popular MUD/MOO
clients are described in <A HREF="http://nowhere.org/not_yet_written.html">another
text</A>.

<P><A HREF="#contents">(to table of contents)</A>
<H2>
<A NAME="operating_system"></A>What operating system do I need to run a
MOO?</H2>
MOOs have been run successfully on UNIX, Win95, WinNT, and MacOS (PowerMac)
platforms. As far as we know, there is no publicly available version of
the LambdaMOO Server for the VMS or any of the IBM-specific operating systems
(besides their version of UNIX), nor on any Win3.x system. There have been
some experimental compilations for OS/2. Precompiled versions of the LambdaMOO
Server are available for <A HREF="http://www-personal.engin.umich.edu/~cunkel/WinMOO/winmoo-faq.html">Win95/NT</A>
(runs on both) and for the <A HREF="http://neon.ci.lexington.ma.us/SpamCentral/scaron/mgm.html">MacOS</A>.
For these precompiled versions, you simply need to obtain a copy of the
executable software and install it appropriately on your system, following
the documentation given for each. Although precompiled versions may be
available for certain UNIX flavors, most people prefer to compile a copy
on their own system, to better insure it matches their system's enviroment.
The LambdaMOO Server has been compiled for most common forms of UNIX. The
"make" system support that comes with the LambdaMOO source package, together
with a modern C compiler (e.g. GCC), is usually able to compile the Server
successfully on UNIX computers without any modifications, requiring only
a minimal familiarity with UNIX.

<P>Note that many MOO administrators using UNIX systems apply one or more
patches to the source code before compiling, to modify the capabilities
of the Server. Several commonly used patches are publically available,
and can provide very useful features such as access from the MOO to the
computer's file system, or access to the UNIX timezone functions. Since
the Win95/NT and MacOS versions of the LambdaMOO Server come precompiled,
you generally don't have the option of including patches if you use one
of these two versions. However, the MacOS version accepts "plug-ins" and
if a patch is available in the form of a plug-in, you may be able to use
the patch through that mechanism. In addition, versions of the Win95/NT
Server may become available with popular patches compiled in. You should
check the Web pages for the <A HREF="http://www-personal.engin.umich.edu/~cunkel/WinMOO/winmoo-faq.html">Win95/NT</A>
and the <A HREF="http://neon.ci.lexington.ma.us/SpamCentral/scaron/mgm.html">MacOS</A>
versions of the LambdaMOO Server for more information.

<P>The following table presents the systems on which the current version
of the UNIX LambdaMOO Server has been tested by the developer, and is taken
from the README file that comes with the LambdaMOO 1.8.0 Server. Note that
it is not a complete list of the UNIX varients for which the LambdaMOO
Server can be compiled, but only those that were specifically tested by
the developer. The MOO will compile fairly easily on most common UNIX systems,
although adjustments to the compilation parameters are sometimes needed.

<A NAME="hardware"></A>What hardware do I need to run a MOO?</H2>
The hardware requirements for operating a MOO vary with the type of operating
system, the number of rooms and other objects in the MOO Database (i.e.
its size), the number of people who will be using the MOO concurrently,
and the amount of additional activity the Server will be supporting (such
as a Web-MOO interface). When the hardware supporting a MOO is unable to
handle the amount of activity the MOO requires, this generally appears
as "lag" in the MOO: a delay between when someone issues a command, and
when the command is executed.

<P>The primary determinant of a system's ability to support a MOO is the
amount of RAM it has available for the MOO, after the amount needed for
the operating system and other concurrently running processes is taken.
Systems without sufficient memory to hold a significant portion of the
MOO Database in RAM will experience a great deal of hard disk activity,
as the operating system swaps portions of the Database between hard disk
and RAM. Although CPU speed can be a cause of lag on very slow systems,
or when there are many concurrent users, for most systems it is the lack
of sufficient memory and consequent need for a great deal of disk swapping
that causes lag. The best solution to this problem is to have sufficient
free RAM on the computer to hold at least one third, and preferably one
half of the running Database. In a system that doesn't have enough RAM
to prevent significant disk swapping, using a fast hard disk access system
(e.g. fast, wide SCSI) may help somewhat. Systems on which less than a
third of the Database can be (or is normally) held in RAM will commonly
show at least some lag when a dozen or more people use the MOO concurrently.
It is important to note that the size of the MOO running in memory is typically
about 175% of the size of the Database on the hard disk (or 220% for 64-bit
systems such as the DEC Alpha or SGI n64) In addition, when the MOO writes
a periodic backup copy of the Database to the disk (i.e. performs a "checkpoint"),
it may nearly double in size. For this reason, systems that are barely
sufficient to run the MOO effectively will commonly lag during checkpoints.

<P>You can estimate the amount of RAM you'll need to operate the MOO at
peak efficiency by multiplying the size of the Database on the hard disk
by 1.75 (or 2.2 for 32-bit systems), and adding the amount of RAM taken
up by the operating system and any other processes running on the same
computer. MOO core Databases range in size from about 1.5 to 4.5 MB, and
therefore require about 3 to 8 MB available to run effectively. Note that
the MOO system will take twice as much memory during checkpoints.

<P>It is very rare that a MOO Database will close to the size of the original
core, unless you use drastic restrictions on the amount of building that
MOO users may do. MOO Databases commonly grow to 10-20 MB within one to
two years, which can require significantly more memory to support effectively.
The largest MOO Databases are over 100 MB in size. In general, you should
expect to need at least 32 MB of RAM on your system to effectively support
an active MOO, with an upgrade to 64 or 128 MB installed one year from
starting operation if the MOO is very successful and you encourage people
to build.

<P>Note that non-UNIX operating systems are typically not designed to handle
numerous simultaneous network connections. For this reason, non-UNIX systems
may be unable to handle more than 50-100 concurrent users without experiencing
lag. Some WinNT systems may be able to handle as many concurrent connections
as UNIX systems.

<P>In general, any processor with performance at least as good as a Pentium/75
MHz can run a MOO, although faster clocks may improve the ability to handle
more concurrent connections. In nearly all cases, however, available RAM
is the primary determinant of how effectively the MOO runs, with hard disk
access speed a distant second. The equivalent to an Intel 486/66 may be
sufficient for a MOO with no more than one or two dozen user connections
and minimal use of a Web-MOO interface, if it is supplied with a generous
amount of RAM.

<P>If the MOO supports a Web-MOO interface, and most of the users will
be operating that interface when they are in the MOO, this will put an
additional burden on the computer as a certain amount of extra processing
overhead is incurred by the Web-MOO interface. However, very little research
has been done to determine the actual impact of this additional overhead.
It is likely that even a moderately fast processor (i.e. equivalent to
a Pentium/120) provided with adequate RAM can handle any reasonable amount
of Web-MOO interface activity.

<P>In general, a single MOO is limited to 100-300 concurrent users. It
is likely that only UNIX systems are able to handle MOOs that have both
large Databases and more than 100 concurrent users, although little exploration
of this issue has been done thus far. In addition, at the time of this
writing there is an effort being made to improve the efficiency of the
LambdaMOO Server, which has been having a significant impact on performance.
For this reason, it's not entirely clear what the real capacity of MOOs
will be in the near future. Also, MOOs have been linked together into groups,
providing a sense of unity for users across the system while supporting
significantly larger number of concurrent connections. Very little research
has been done into how many concurrent users can be supported using such
a mechanism.

<P><A HREF="#contents">(to table of contents)</A>
<H2>
<A NAME="network"></A>What kind of network connection do I need between
my MOO and the Internet?</H2>
Since the MOO accepts and generates only text, it puts very little burden
on the network to which it is connected. Relative to the graphics and streaming
video that are rapidly growing as a proportion of network traffic, the
MOO's contribution is trivial. This is true even on a MOO with several
hundred users. Some years back, it was a common misconception among ill-informed
system operators that MOOs caused a great deal of traffic on school campus
networks, and were a significant problem. The rise of the Web and its high-bandwidth
graphics has rendered all such considerations irrelevent, and this misconception
is now rarely held by any employed system operators.

<P>In general, nearly any network connection can support a MOO. Even a
28K modem link is sufficient for a MOO without too many concurrent users,
if that link is also not used for a Web server providing graphics. MOOs
providing a Web-MOO interface for more than a dozen concurrent users should
probably have at least a 128K link, since the MOO will generate HTML text
files in bursts that may hog a 28K line if several are being sent at once.

<P>Note that MOOs providing a Web-MOO interface do not actually serve the
graphics themselves, but only generate HTML text files that include Internet
pointers (i.e. URLs), to the graphics or other multimedia material. The
actual graphics may be anywhere on the Internet. If your MOO will incorporate
graphics through a Web-MOO interface, there is no need to have the Web
server that stores and provides those graphics on the same computer, or
even the same network, as the one carrying the MOO.

<P><A HREF="#contents">(to table of contents)</A>
<H2>
<A NAME="database"></A>Do I need a specific MOO core Database for my operating
system?</H2>
Of the two components of a MOO, the Server and the Database, only the Server
must be specially compiled for a particular platform. The Database is generally
platform-independent. For this reason, you can use any of the available
MOO core Databases to establish your MOO.

<P>Note that a special situation arises if you wish to use a MOO Database
that has already been in use with one type of operating system, and will
run it on another. In such a case, there will be MOO characters that have
been created and assigned passwords. Because the password encryption system
differs among different operating systems, the old passwords will usually
not function under the new operating system. The usual solution is to load
the MOO database in "emergency wizard mode" and set the archwizard password
to zero, then to connect to that character and issue new passwords to every
character in the MOO. Specific instructions for how to do this are <A HREF="#db_conversion">given
in the appendix</A>. However, some MOO cores might use a platform-independent,
in-DB encryption system, in which case the passwords will work no matter
what operating system the MOO Database is transferred to. Unless the documentation
for the MOO core you have used specifies that it uses a platform-independent,
in-DB password encryption system, it probably does not.

<P><A HREF="#contents">(to table of contents)</A>
<H2>
<A NAME="appendix"></A>Appendix</H2>

<H3>
<A NAME="db_conversion"></A>How do I convert a MOO Database from one operating
system to another?</H3>
If you are using a MOO Database other than a core to establish a MOO, there
is typically a problem of incompatible password encryption systems if the
new operating system that will be running the MOO is of a different general
type that the one the Database was initially developed on. This is almost
always the case when switching between UNIX, Win95, WinNT, and MacOS systems,
and may also rarely be encountered when switching between different UNIX
systems. The solution to the problem is to generate new passwords for all
the characters in the MOO. It is assumed that you will have a regular charater
on the MOO, so you can test to insure the passwords have been reinitialized
properly. Note also that in order to send out the new passwords to each
person, the MOO will need to be able to send email (i.e. been compiled
with outbound connections allowed, have $network.active set to 1, and have
a valid $network.maildrop address).

<P>BE SURE TO SET ASIDE A COPY OF THE DATABASE AS A BACKUP BEFORE FOLLOWING
THIS PROCEDURE!!!!

<P>The passwords may be reinitialized, and mail sent to all users informing
them of their new password as follows:

<P>1. Modify the script or command that launches the MOO to start it in
"emergency wizard mode." This generally means adding the switch "-e" after
the "moo" command itself, in the script, batch file, or command line used
to launch the MOO. After the MOO loads, it should inform you that it is
entering emergency wizard mode, rather than present the regular welcome
screen. Note that if you are using a Win95/NT or MacOS system, this appears
in the "console" display. You do not need to connect to the MOO via Telnet
to use emergency wizard mode, and in fact you can't.

<P>2. Set the archiwizard's password to zero, to allow you to connect to
it without a password. In nearly all MOOs, the archwizard is object #2,
so set the password with:

<P>;#2.password = 0

<P>3. Determine the name of the archwizard character with:

<P>;#2.name

<P>4. Type "continue" to exit emergency wizard mode and allow the MOO to
start listening for connections.

<P>5. Connect to the MOO's regular text interface, using your favorite
MUD/MOO client program. From there, connect to the archwizard character
with:

<P>connect &lt;name> ""

<P>where &lt;name> is the name (not in quotes) that you obtained in step
3, and the `""' is a pair of double quotes with nothing between them.

<P>6. At this point, you should be connected to the archwizard character.
Now add the command that will set new passwords for everyone, using:

<P>@verb me:@initpasswords none none none rd

<P>7. Now program the command by entering the following lines, including
the last line, which is just a period on a line by itself:

<P>@program me:@initpasswords
<BR>if (caller!=this)
<BR>return player:notify("Nope.");
<BR>elseif (!this.wizard)
<BR>return player:notify("Sorry, only a wizard character can do this, and
you are not one.");
<BR>endif
<BR>for who in (setremove(setremove(players(),#2),$hacker))
<BR>if (who.password &amp;&amp; !index(who.password," "))
<BR>"skip guests and characters with passwords that are impossible to type";
<BR>$wiz_utils:set_password(who, password=$wiz_utils:random_password(6),
#2);
<BR>if ($network.active &amp;&amp; who.email_address)
<BR>"send the new password by email";
<BR>$network:raw_sendmail(who.email_address, "Date: " + $time_utils:ctime_for_email(),
tostr("From: ",$network.MOO_name," &lt;",$network.reply_address,">"), tostr("To:
",who.name," &lt;",who.email_address,">"), "Subject: new password", "",
tostr("The password for your MOO character ",who.name," at ",$network.MOO_name,"
has been changed to: ",password),"Please use this new password the next
time you connect to your MOO character.");
<BR>endif
<BR>endif
<BR>$command_utils:suspend_if_needed(10);
<BR>"use a long suspend, since the sendmail tasks tend to pile up badly";
<BR>endfor
<BR>player:notify("Done!");
<BR>.

<P>8. Type "@initpassword" to run the command. The MOO will generate new
passwords for every registered character in the MOO who has ever connected,
and send out email notifying them of their new password.

<P>9. Finally, you should set the password for the archwizard character.
If the archwizard is not actually used as an active character (recommended),
then use:

<P>@set me.password to "impossible password to type"

<P>otherwise use:

<P>@newpassword me is &lt;password>

<P>to set a new password for yourself. On some MOOs, you may have to use
"@password" instead of the "@newpassword" command.

<P>10. Before using "@quit" to end your session, try connecting to your
regular, non-wizard character on the MOO to make sure the new passwords
have been set properly.

<P>11. After you have successfully re-initialized the passwords for the
MOO, you should remove the @initpasswords command with:

<P>@rmverb #2:@initpasswords
