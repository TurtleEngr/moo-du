Setting Up the MOO's UNIX Directory Structure</H1>
Generally, educational MOOs are maintained by a group of people. For this
reason, it is convenient to have more than one person be able to maintain
the MOO server site, including having the ability to edit and rearrange
files on the site. This document details the arrangement of files and directories
that Diversity University's experience has found to be effective, and describes
the function of each file and directory.

<P>This document does not give instructions for compiling the LambdaMOO
Server, which is described elsewhere.

<P>In this example, an admnistrative account is established called "ourmoo"
and an administrative group named "mooadmin" is also created. You will
typically want to customize this for your own site.

<P>Although you don't have to have root access to the computer to set up
most of the MOO's system, you will need someone with root access to create
the base directory for the structure (given as "~ourmoo" in the example
below), and to create a "ourmoo" account and a "mooadmin" group.

<P>NOTE: The "~ourmoo" directory described below should be set to mode
"g+s" before you create any subdirectories within it. In addition, you
should use the "umask 007" command either in your ".cshrc" file or by hand
before creating the files and subdirectories described here, to save the
work of having to adjust their mode later.
<H2>
Basic Structure</H2>
You should generally have an account for the MOO project itself, called
"ourmoo" in the example below, although people will generally use their
own UNIX account for performing maintenance. In addition, there should
be a UNIX group for people who will be performing maintenance, called "mooadmin"
in this example.

<P>Diversity University recommends the following structure for a site:
<UL>~ourmoo/
<BR>~ourmoo/bin/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(scripts and other maintenance tools for MOO support)
<BR>~ourmoo/home/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (home
directories of your maintenance staff)
<BR>~ourmoo/moo/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(all resources associated with the MOO itself)
<BR>~ourmoo/moo/files/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (files created and used by the
MOO's FUP system)
<BR>~ourmoo/moo/backup.dbs/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (backup copies
of the MOO database)
<BR>~ourmoo/moo/backup.logs/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (earlier logs
created by the running MOO)
<BR>~ourmoo/moo/server-source/&nbsp;&nbsp; (the files used to create a
LambdaMOO Server executable)
<BR>~ourmoo/moo/server-source/MOO-1.8.0p6&nbsp;&nbsp; (the source files
for the LambdaMOO Server)
<BR>~ourmoo/moo/server-source/patches&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (patches
applied to the MOO Server before compiling)</UL>
Every directory in this structure should have mode settings o+rwx, g+rwxs,
and be owned by the user "ourmoo" and the "mooadmin" group.

<P>Note that all the directories are mode g+s (group SUID). Under most
UNIX systems, this insures that files and subdirectories created within
these directories will have the same group ownership as the parent directory.
This helps insure that these resources will all be manipulatable by your
maintenance staff.

<P>In addition, if the accounts for your maintenance staff will be used
only for maintaining the MOO, then you should insure that all files and
subdirectories they create are group-writable, by including the line:
<UL>umask 007</UL>
in the ".cshrc" file of their home directory. If you are not using a C-shell,
you will need to adjust accordingly. Note that you might want to have such
a ".cshrc" prepared in the "~ourmoo" directory, and then have the personal
".cshrc" files of individual users contain:
<UL>source ~ourmoo/.cshrc</UL>
as their only line. If their work will not be group-writable by default,
your staff will need to remember to appropriately "chmod" the files and
directories that they create.
<H2>
Directory ~ourmoo/bin/</H2>
This directory contains the scripts and other maintenance tools used for
MOO support. If you have other software installed specifically for use
by MOO maintenance staff, it should generally go here. The scripts that
Diversity University has developed and recommends are:
<UL>
<LI>
runmoo Starts the MOO running.</LI>

<LI>
killmoo Stops the running MOO.</LI>

<LI>
statmoo Provides assorted MOO server stats.</LI>

<LI>
watchmoo Shows a continuing display of the MOO log.</LI>

<LI>
dobackup Creates a backup copy of the MOO database.</LI>

<LI>
chown Changes the ownership of a file (useful for systems in which this
is generally not allowed; must be SUID root).</LI>
</UL>
IMPORTANT: You will need to change some configuration lines in each of
these scripts to enable them to run correctly! Generally, this involves
specifying what the MOO system's base directory is (e.g. "/usr/ourmoo/")
and in what directory the MOO database is located (e.g. "usr/ourmoo/moo").

<P>The "statmoo" script can be used as a cgi-bin if you have a Web server
that supports these. This allows you to check the status of the MOO through
the Web. Generally, it can simply be copied to the appropriate directory
where such applications belong, and usually renamed to "statmoo.cgi" (mostly
for clarity, since this isn't generally required).

<P>You'll probably want to add "~ourmoo/bin" to your PATH, to enable you
to issue commands like "runmoo" and "watchmoo" without giving the full
path for those scripts. You'll generally have to expand "~ourmoo" to its
full specification (e.g. "/usr/ourmoo") for setting the PATH environment
variable.
<H2>
Directory ~ourmoo/moo/</H2>
Files and subdirectories in ~ourmoo/moo include the MOO database and server,
logs, and other files directly associated with the MOO itself. This directory
include:
<TABLE WIDTH="100%" >
<TR>
<TD><B><U>modes</U></B></TD>

<TD><B><U>group</U></B></TD>

<TD><B><U>owner</U></B></TD>

<TR>
<TD>drwxrwx---</TD>

<TD>ourmoo</TD>

<TD>mooadmin</TD>

<TD>server-source</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
&nbsp;

<P>This directory also must contain a link named "moo" to the "~ourmoo/moo/server-source/MOO-1.8.0p6/moo"
executable file (the compiled LambdaMOO Server itself).
<UL>lrwxrwxrwx moo -> server-source/MOO-1.8.0p6/moo</UL>
The ourmoo.db file is the MOO database itself. If you are starting with
an eDUcore, you will want to place a copy in this directory and rename
the database appropriately (with a ".db" extension). Note that you don't
have to name the MOO database according to the name of the administrative
username ("ourmoo" in this example), although it must have the ".db" extension.
The name given to the MOO database, however, will be used as the base for
some of the other supporting files (e.g. the log files), and you may need
to adjust the configuration of the supporting scripts appropriately.

<P>The crontab.ourmoo file gives the schedule for the nightly full backups
of the MOO database (and associated FUP file system). An example is provided
in the eDUcore server setup package. Note that you'll need to modify it
to fit your own directory names and structure.

<P>Note that other files will be automatically created when you run the
MOO, including:
<UL>-rw-rw---- ourmoo mooadmin du.log
<BR>-rw-rw---- ourmoo mooadmin moo.pid
<BR>-rw-rw---- ourmoo mooadmin du.restart.log
<BR>-rw-rw---- ourmoo mooadmin du_backup.log
<BR>-rw-rw---- ourmoo mooadmin du_backup.pid</UL>
The "du.log" file is the log for the running MOO, which is transferred
to the "backup.logs" directory each time the MOO is restarted.

<P>The "moo.pid" file is the current PID for the MOO process, written by
the "runmoo" script, and which is used by the "killmoo" and "statmoo" scripts.

<P>The "du.restart.log" notes each time the MOO is restarted, and is written
to by the "runmoo" script.

<P>The "du_backup.log" and "du_backup.pid" files are the log and current
PID for the nightly full MOO backup process. The "dobackup" script writes
to them.
<H2>
Directory ~ourmoo/moo/backup.logs</H2>
When the MOO is restarted, the "runmoo" script appends the existing "~ourmoo/moo/ourmoo.log"
file to a file in this directory. Note that the logs continue to get appended,
so this file can grow rather large. We recommend renaming and compressing
it quarterly. The compressed log archives can be stored in this directory.
<H2>
Directory ~ourmoo/moo/backup.dbs</H2>
The nightly full backup of the MOO database and associated FUP files is
stored here by the "dobackup" script. Depending upon the settings in the
"~ourmoo/moo/crontab.ourmoo" file, several days of nightly backups are
retained (usually three to seven). In addition, you should rename one of
the nightly backup archive files monthly, quarterly, and annually for longer-term
retention, depending on your needs and amount of available disk space.
<H2>
Direcotry ~ourmoo/moo/files</H2>
This directory is used by the MOO's FUP system, if it has been installed.
We strongly recommend you use FUP, since it allows the MOO to store mail
system texts, and other texts, outside the database itself. Mail system
texts are usually one of the largest resources in the MOO, in terms of
amount of memory it takes up. In order to minimize the size of the database,
we recommend using the FUP system to "externalize" the mail system. The
MOO itself will create all the files and subdirectories needed in the "~ourmoo/moo/files"
directory. How to modify the MOO to use externalized mail is described
in the MOO's internal help system under the "disk-mail" topic.

<P>The MOO also uses the FUP system to retrieve it's Web Gateway page,
from "~ourmoo/moo/files/web/gateway.html" if that file exists. This enables
a simple mechanism to provide the same gateway page through both the MOO
and an external Web server.
<H2>
Directory ~ourmoo/moo/server-source</H2>
This directory contains the source files and compiled version of the LambdaMOO
server, server patches, and any previous versions of the LambdaMOO server
you may choose to retain. A typical structure for this directory is:
<UL>-rw-rw---- ourmoo mooadmin LambdaMOO-1_8_0p6_tar.gz
<BR>drwxrws--- ourmoo mooadmin MOO-1.8.0p6
<BR>drwxrws--- ourmoo mooadmin patches</UL>
We assume here that you have only the 1.8.0p6 version of the MOO server
installed. Note that for this example the link at "~ourmoo/moo/moo" points
to the executable file "moo" in the "~ourmoo/moo/server-source/MOO-1.8.0p6/"
directory. That directory is generally created automatically when you fully
expand the "LambdaMOO-1_8_0p6_tar.gz" file.

<P>The "~ourmoo/moo/server-source/patches/" directory should contain the
MOO server patches that you will be applying to the MOO server before compiling
it. Diversity University recommends several patches, which are available
at:
<UL>http://www.du.org/educore/patches/</UL>
These patches should be placed in this directory. Generally, you can do
this just by downloading the archive file containing all the patches into
this directory, and expanding it. Application of the patches, and how to
compile the LambdaMOO Server, is described in a separate document.
