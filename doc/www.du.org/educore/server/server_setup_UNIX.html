Compiling the LambdaMOO Server for UNIX</H1>
This document provides step-by-step instructions for compiling the LambdaMOO
Server on a UNIX system. Note that the instructions for compiling the Server
are also given in the "readme" file included with the LambdaMOO Server
package. This text is provided particularly to describe how to apply patches
to the server before compiling it, including those patches recommended
by Diversity University.

<P>In order to run a MOO, including one based on the eDUcore, you must
obtain compiled version of the LambdaMOO Server. Note that Diversity University
does not provide the LambdaMOO Server. However, it is available free to
the public through the work of several people who have participated in
developing it over the years. The LambdaMOO Server is currently maintained
by Erik Eostrom.

<P>For the examples described here, it is assumed you have followed the
instructions in the separate text entitled "Setting Up the MOO's UNIX Directory
Structure." Similarly, it is assumed for the sake of example that the base
administrative account is named "ourmoo" although yours will probably be
different. If you have not created a directory structure to support the
MOO as described in that text, you will need to modify the instructions
given here accordingly.

<P>A minimal amount of UNIX experience is assumed for these instructions,
assuming you are using one of the common UNIX versions, which are generally
supported by the LambdaMOO Server's installation scripts.

<P>Your UNIX system must have several common resources used to compile
applications, and the Server installation system must be able to find them.
Generally, the system will find these resources itself if they are in any
standard location. These resources include bison or yacc. If you have the
GNU C-compiler installed, you will probably have all the resources needed.
Compiling the LambdaMOO Server under unusual configurations is not covered
in this document.

<P>The steps for compiling the LambdaMOO Server are:

<P><B><U>1.</U></B> Obtain a copy of the latest package from:
<UL>ftp://ftp.research.att.com/dist/eostrom/MOO/</UL>
For this example, we'll assume you have "gzip" software already installed
and will be downloading the "LambdaMOO-1_8_0p6_tar.gz" file version of
the LambdaMOO Server package. Place the compressed package in the "~ourmoo/moo/server-source"
directory.

<P><B><U>2.</U></B> Expand the package fully with:
<UL>gzip -dc LambdaMOO-1_8_0p6_tar.gz | tar -xf -</UL>
This will create a "MOO-1.8.0p6" subdirectory containing all the source
and other files associated with the package.

<P><B><U>3.</U></B> Change to the "MOO-1.8.0p6" directory, display and
read the "readme" file. This document will take you through the steps described
in that file, in addition to those for applying server patches before compiling.

<P><B><U>4.</U></B> Run the command "sh configure" to configure the package
for your local environment. Note that it will recommend one or a set of
possible networking settings that you will need later. Generally, either
"NS_BSD" or "NS_SYSV" will be recommended (sometimes both).<B><U></U></B>

<P><B><U>5.</U></B> Using your favorite UNIX text editor, modify the "options.h"
file for your local environment. Generally, the items that you will need
to change are:
<UL>#define DEFAULT_PORT</UL>
By default this is 7777, but many educational MOOs use 8888 instead. At
organizations in which firewall restrictions by port are in effect, this
can be important. Note that you can start the MOO listening on a different
port when you run it, so the setting in this file isn't critical.
<UL>#define NETWORK_STYLE</UL>
By default this is NS_BSD, and if the "sh configure" command results recommended
that as an option, you can keep this. If the MOO is unable to start, and
reports some kind of networking problem, then change it to "NS_SYSV" (assuming
that was also recommended as a legitimate setting by the "sh configure"
system).
<UL>/* #define OUTBOUND_NETWORK */</UL>
You will need to un-comment this line (to "#define OUTBOUND_NETWORK") in
order to enable functions like sending email from the MOO to people with
characters, and many other MOO features. Note that because the MOO is able
to establish outbound connections if this is un-commented, the MOO may
have access to materials on a local network associated with the MOO's site.
Generally, only MOO wizards will be able to use such functions, unless
your staff creates an insecure MOO object. For this reason, secure installations
should place the MOO on a "public" part of the network, on which public
access is not compromising.

<P><B><U>6.</U></B> Try compiling the LambdaMOO Server (this time without
the patches) using the "make" command. This will determine if your system
has all the resources needed to compile the Server, and if the "make" system
can find them. The Server should compile after many informational, and
possibly some warning, messages. If the process runs to completion, you
can generally ignore the warnings. If the process does NOT run to completion,
you're probably either missing some resources needed to compile the server,
or they're located in unusual places. There are various ways to adjust
the compilation to accommodate unusual system setups, but these are not
covered in this document. If the Server successfully compiles, continue
by installing the patches.

<P><B><U>7.</U></B> Apply the server patches that you will be using. First
make a link to the directory where the patches are located, with:
<UL>ln -s ../patches patches</UL>
Then edit each of the patches to configure them appropriately for your
system. Read the header on each patch file for more instructions on how
to do this. A description of each patch file, and the configuration changes
needed for each, are in an appendix to this document. Finally, apply the
recommended patches with:
<UL>patch -l &lt; patches/moo-1.8.0-pAS9.patch
<BR>patch -l &lt; patches/moo-1.8.0-pAS5.patch
<BR>patch -l &lt; patches/moo-1.8.0-pAS5.c.patch
<BR>patch -l &lt; patches/moo-1.8.0-FUP.patch
<BR>patch -l &lt; patches/moo-1.8.0-files.c.patch</UL>
Note that the switch after "patch" in each line is the letter "ell" and
not the number one.

<P><B><U>8.</U></B> Re-compile the Server using the "make" command again.
The Server should once again run to completion. On some systems, it will
abort with an error reading "`FUP_version' undeclared (first use this function)."
If you get this error, then install the FUP.errfix patch with:
<UL>patch -l &lt; patches/moo-1.8.0-FUP.errfix.patch</UL>
If the Server does not compile to completion, then generally either you
did not follow the instructions here, or your UNIX system has some kind
of unusual configuration.

<P><B><U>9.</U></B> At this point, you should have a executable file named
"moo" in the ""MOO-1.8.0p6" " subdirectory (make sure to change its mode
to u+x, g+x if it is not already, with "chmod u+x,g+x moo").

<P><B><U>10.</U></B> Finally, create a soft link to the LambdaMOO Server
executable file from the directory where the MOO database is located. You
can do this with:
<UL>cd ~ourmoo/moo
<BR>ln -s server-source/MOO-1.8.0p6/moo moo</UL>
If you have modified the "runmoo" script appropriately, and placed a MOO
database in the "~ourmoo/moo/" directory, you should now be able to issue
"~ourmoo/bin/runmoo" to start the MOO.
<H2>
Appendix A: Performing Automatic Nightly Database Backups</H2>
Diversity University strongly recommends that you establish nightly MOO
database backups, to save a copy of your database and its associated FUP
files. On UNIX systems, this is generally performed using the "crontab"
system. To use this system, you'll need to create a small file specifying
when the backup should be made. Also, a script call "dobackup" is part
of the scripts that Diversity University provides for UNIX system users,
which we recommend using. A copy of "crontab.moo" was also included with
the scripts to serve as an example. The "dobackup" script should be in
the "~ourmoo/bin" directory, and "crontab.moo" should be moved to the "~ourmoo/moo"
directory.

<P>You will need to edit the "crontab.moo" file to schedule the nightly
archiving of your MOO. In the example, you'll find a single line:
<UL>2 * * * /usr/du/world/bin/dobackup du 7 >> /usr/du/world/moo/du_backup.log
2>&amp;1</UL>
This specifies that the backup should be done every night at 2 AM, running
the "dobackup" script for the "du.db" database, and that only the last
seven days of backups should be saved. Note that only the file name prefix
("du") is specified in the "crontab.moo" file

<P>You must change the values of "/usr/du/world/bin/dobackup" to specify
where your "dobackup" script is. Note that on some UNIX system, you can't
use a value such as "~ourmoo" but must give the complete path. Similarly,
you should change the value of "/usr/du/world/moo/du_backup.log" to give
the name of the backup log file you wish kept. You'd use "/usr/ourmoo/moo/ourmoo_backup.log"
in our example.

<P>The backup system will write to the "~ourmoo/moo/backup.dbs" directory
a compressed archive of the MOO database and FUP files, deleting the oldest
such archive if it's older than seven days. You can decrease this number
if space on the hard disk is a problem, but we recommend you save at least
the last three days of database archives.

<P>You must also edit the "dobackup" script for your system. In it, you'll
find the lines:
<UL>set MOOhome = "/usr/du/world/moo"
<BR>set gzhome = "/usr/du/world/bin"</UL>
You'll need to change these to point to the directory where your MOO database
is located ("MOOhome"), and where your gzip executable file is located
("gzhome"). Note that if you don't have gzip, but have the regular "compress"
utility, the "dobackup" script can be modified to use that. However, gzip,
freely available from the GNU Project, is more effective and is recommended.

<P>Finally, once you've edited the "dubackup" script and the "crontab.moo"
file, submit the request for periodic backups by changing to the "~ourmoo/moo"
directory and entering:
<UL>crontab crontab.moo</UL>
You should then be able to check the submission was successful with the
"crontab -l" command, and see that the backup is running successfully by
checking the next day in the "ourmoo_backup.log" file and in the "backup.dbs"
directory.

Appendix B: MOO Server Patches</H2>
The recommended MOO Server patches are:
<H3>
pAS5</H3>
<U>Description:</U> Written by Alex Stewart. Provides additional built-in
functions that allow the MOO to access certain UNIX time zone functions.
That is preferable to using the plain MOO server's rather weak support
for time zones.

<P><U>File names:</U> moo-1.8.0-pAS5.patch and moo-1.8.0-pAS5.c.patch

<P><U>Installation:</U> No configuration changes generally need to be made
to the "moo-1.8.0-pAS5.patch" file. Although it might not be absolutely
needed on your machine, it's often a good idea to set the TZ variable in
the moo-1.8.0-pAS5.c.patch file explicitly. Look for the line
<UL>+ static char tzdefault[] = "TZ=localtime";</UL>
And change "localtime" to the appropriate time zone specification for your
site (e.g. "EST8EDT" for U.S. Eastern Time, or "PST8PDT" for U.S. Pacific
Time).
<H3>
pAS9</H3>
<U>Description:</U> Written by Alex Stewart. Provides backspace support
for bad telnet clients. Some really poor telnet clients handle backspace/delete
keys in a nonstandard way. This patch makes the MOO a bit more forgiving
for those.

<P><U>File name:</U> moo-1.8.0-pAS9.patch

<P><U>Installation:</U> No configuration changes need to be made to this
file.
<H3>
FUP</H3>
<U>Description:</U> Written by Jaime Prilusky and Gustavo Glusman. This
is the File Utilities Package system, written as patch files. FUP allows
the MOO to store various sections of database information externally in
files on the UNIX server. See the FUP documentation for more details on
custom configuration of the FUP system. This patchfile is set to provide
the most commonly desired configuration.

<P><U>File names:</U> moo-1.8.0-FUP.patch and moo-1.8.0-files.c.patch

<P><U>Installation:</U> The "moo-1.8.0-FUP.patch" file generally doesn't
need any configuration changes. Some users will want to change the configuration
specified in the "moo-1.8.0-FUP.c.patch" file

<P>The line:
<UL>+ /* #define EXTERN_FILES_DIR_READ_ONLY */</UL>
specifies that the MOO will not be allowed to write to the "~ourmoo/moo/files/"
directory, but only directories that you've created within it. We recommend
you enable this function, however, by un-commenting the line (e.g. change
it to "+ #define EXTERN_FILES_DIR_READ_ONLY").

<P>The line:
<UL>+ /* #define INCLUDE_FILERUN */</UL>
specifies that the MOO's FUP system will not be allowed to run commands
on the MOO computer. You can remove the comment marks (i.e. change the
line to "+ #define INCLUDE_FILERUN") if you wish to enable this. Generally
it is unnecessary and not recommended.
<H3>
FUP.errfix</H3>
<U>Description:</U> This patch is to be used ONLY if there is a problem
with version.c after you try using "make" to compile the system. If you
get the error "`FUP_version' undeclared (first use this function)" and
the compilation fails.

<P><U>File name:</U> moo-1.8.0-FUP.errfix.patch

<P><U>Installation:</U> Install this patch in the standard way, but ONLY
if you get the stated error when compiling. After applying the patch, issue
the "make" command again to recompile.
