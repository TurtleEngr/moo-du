MOO Technical Support Scripts</H1>
Here you'll find various UNIX scripts, DOS batch files, and other tools
useful for maintaining a MOO. The UNIX material is derived from those that
Diversity University uses in its own operations.

<P>The complete set of UNIX support scripts is available as a <A HREF="server_scripts.tar.gz">compressed
archive</A>. A set of <A HREF="winmoo_batch.zip">batch
files</A> is available for those running a MOO on a Win95 or WinNT system.
<H2>
<A NAME="UNIX"></A><A HREF="server_scripts.tar.gz">UNIX
Scripts</A></H2>
Certain sub-directory structures are assumed, and if yours are different
you may have to perform some customization of the scripts. We find our
arrangement very convenient though, so you might want to emulate it. The
basic structure is:

</TABLE>
&nbsp;

<P>All DU server maintenance personnel have the du/bin directory added
to their PATH list. They can issue "runmoo" to start the MOO. The MOO is
halted from inside the MOO itself, using the @shutdown command. Our runmoo
command is the equivalent to the "restart" script distributed with the
LambdaMOO server.

<P>The watchmoo script is a simple method of watching the MOO's log continuously,
which is especially useful when starting or stopping the server.

<P>The nightly archiving system, which stores a copy of the MOO database
as well as a copy of all FUP-based external files, must be started separately.
The backup process stores all these as a single tar.gz file. See the crontab.moo
file, and change the values to point to your MOO database. Note that this
is also where to set how many days of backups you want. For instance, you
might want a running 7 day backup set, and once a week set aside (by hand)
a copy for long-term storage. Once you've customized the dobackup and crontab.moo
files appropriately, use "crontab crontab.moo" to schedule the backup process.

<P>Note that you must have access to gzip and tar on your system for the
nightly archiving to function.

<P>Although one person can generally maintain the UNIX side of the MOO
operation, it is common to have a group of people who do so. To allow a
group to all have access to the required files, we suggest the following:
<BR>&nbsp;
<OL>
<LI>
&nbsp;Establish a UNIX group to own all MOO-related materials (add a line
to the /etc/group file). It might be called "mookeepers" for example. Make
sure all maintenance personnel are in the group, either by having their
name in the /etc/group file entry, or through their /etc/passwd file entry.</LI>

<LI>
&nbsp;When you create the /usr/moo directory that will hold all MOO-related
files, make sure it is, a) owned by the mookeepers group, b) the sticky-bit
for the directory is set. This will insure that all files and sub-directories
created under this directory are owned by the mookeepers group. If you
already created /usr/moo directory (or whatever you called it), change
the group ownership of that directory and all its contents (you may need
your sysop to do this for you)</LI>

<LI>
&nbsp;If the UNIX accounts for your MOO maintenance staff are ONLY used
for MOO maintenance, it is convenient to change their default "umask" setting
such that all files they create will be writable by the other maintainers.
To do this, add the line "umask 007" to the ".login" script in the home
directories of your MOO maintenance staff. This will insure all the files
they create are group-writable, and therefore can be edited by other MOO
maintenance staff.</LI>
</OL>
Note that if they do other work using their account, those files will also
be group-writable unless specifically altered. If your staff routinely
do both MOO maintenance and personal work on the UNIX system, you might
consider making special MOO maintenance accounts for them, which will be
in the mookeepers group and have a default umask value making files created
with that account group-writable. Their personal account would neither
be in the mookeepers group, nor use the group-writable umask value.

<P>The chown script is a convenient tool for allowing a group of maintainers
to share files at a site where none of them has root access. When setuid
root, it allows them to chown files back and forth, even if the server
generally restricts such chown'ing, by limiting such actions to only people
within the same group. For instance, all DU maintenance personnel for the
DU Main Campus are in the "du" UNIX system group.

<P>The statmoo and statmoo.cgi scripts give a snapshot summary of the MOO
server operations. The statmoo.cgi is especially useful for determining
if your MOO is using appropriate amounts of server resources. You can see
the DU Main Campus MOO's summary generated by statmoo.cgi at:
<UL>http://www.du.org/statmoo</UL>
The statmoo script just provides a quick summary without analysis. At DU's
site, the statmoo.cgi file is the one accessed, and has been renamed "statmoo"
for convenience. Note that these scripts may not function correctly with
operating systems other than Solaris, unless suitably modified.
